with the same disappointing results, dark phoenix concludes the 20th century fox's x-men saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise. dull, predictable  utterly

care about all this characters at all then? story line seems to be rushing all the way, this is 2019 so i think the director insulting the audiences intelligent. i felt sad and angry after the film finished.\\\", 'good storyline and some good action scenes. started out slow, but got better']\",\n          \"[\\\"so we have a dystopian, coming soon future l.a. where inhabitants riot to get clean h2o. within it is a sanctuary of sorts where wmembership  following the rules you can reside in this sort of a hospital hotel secure from all that's going on in the streets. the nursedoctor runs the place wthe help of a big muscle guy, and robotic medical help. they face all sorts of not-so-nice characters. a bit of violence of course to add spice to the intrigue. script a bit scattered at times, but somewhat creative. acting interesting  different.\\\\nside note there's a scene with a body beneath a pier that is almost identical to a similar scene in breath.\\\", \\\"i really liked the premise of this --10 years in the future, a nurse runs a covert hospital for criminals in downtown l.a., but what you get is some run-of-the-mill heist gone wrong, gotta find a way outta this tight spot narrative that goes exactly where you think it's gonna go. it's cool to look at, jodie foster and jeff goldblum are excellent despite their dull lines, and bautista's character is actually a lot of fun. but, 'hotel artemis' is definitely not the high-octane action-thriller it's being marketed as. the coolest action scene comes at the tail-end of the movie, which makes you wonder why they didn't do that kinda stuff the whole time.\\\", \\\"i won't say that the movie is a blockbuster material but itvwas fun to watch it. the concept is interestingly fresh and screenplay is gripping enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. good momentum.\\\", \\\"as a cinephile who prefers theatrical experiences over sitting at home, the movie is good enough to warrant that extra money. movies out are a chance to get away from it all, suspend any disbelief and go along for a ride that some truly creative folks built for us. this movie does a decent job of that. the hotel set itself is well resolved with just enough grunge tech mixed with sci-fi high end equipment i don't want to spoil anything to keep it fun to look at. it has a coen brothers barton fink fused with terry gilliam's brazil sort of feel. the original fixtures are art deco and then, with the decay of 'everything civilized', the building has been maintained only as needed to serve its purpose, its perfect. the beginning is well paced, you are introduced to the chaos of the outside world with just enough of a storyline to get you to the receiving doors of the hotel. characters all arrive on screen with an orderly almost metronome tempo, each with enough backstory development to keep you entertained. the set is complimented by the wardrobe design which is current and matches the roleplayers they adorn. characters anonymity is done in a slick way and we quickly understand membership and the rules of the day, some john wick echoes here and just as that is settled the main plot line kicks into gear. jodie foster plays her role effortlessly, perhaps too much so, it feels like there is some complex character development left on the editing room floor. she delivers though, and so do the others. bautista manages to shed typecast expectations. sofia boutella has grown as an actor and does a great job having lost her go-to bag of angry eye facial expressions, her action sequences are plausible which is refreshing given some of the incessantly over the top moves seen in other 2018 flicks. sterling k brown is perfect, goldblum too sheds his jurassic park trademark vocal style. all in all, the movie has the right ingredients to be fantastic. i recommend seeing it, absolutely, if you're a movie buff, see it on a big screen. where it under delivers is with the transition of fosters character being in control to everything going sideways. it happens too quickly. there is a lot more room left to develop disdain for the bad guys. it just sort of shifts from fairly tight to fairly predictable and it sort of methodically roles along winding down from there. it got my 7 of 10 for its finish, feel and editing, without that it would warrant maybe a six. better than average for the genre.\\\", \\\"maybe it's just me but i've not heard any buzz surrounding this movie and with the actors involved i figured it was due to its lackluster entertainment value. not only was i surprised, i thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and highly recommend it.\\\", \\\"didn't quite get it, a half-baked potato? sci-fi? two versions of blade runner? a hotel chain of john wick's used to go? l.a. riot for water usage? this hotel is such a ridiculous facility, fixing up the criminals only with futuristic medical devices, every room numbered with some tourist-trap name, the lock mechanism is so complicated, the entryentrance with reinforced steel gate, yet next to the gate is drywall, wtf? then the elevator is on its last leg, an antique. a bag of new and old crap putting together to give you a fuzzy idea of a mixed genre. there's only one nurse to fix all the out patient walk-ins. i have to ask the movie maker what are you trying to show and tell us? what's the point of making this crap? the storyline felt like a very weak patch-up pointless nonsense.\\\"]\",\n          \"['a beautiful movie with a strong message. akshay kumar hits a bullseye again and shines as a

nomination for oscar in regional film category in the year of 2018.', \\\"r. balki cooked this dish with his own recipe alongside swanand kirkire, adding multiple flavors handpicked from balki's arsenal of trademark templates. pc sreeram's cinematography is god level for it does not have any kind of cutting edge cgi in it but has simple and subtle colours and excellent frames. the costumes, the art-work, and editing are definitely added assets to the film. amit trivedi's score is lively and suits balki's taste perfectly. of course, akshay kumar and radhika apte performed really well but

all consistent and the first half drags so much without making any point. but the subject and its reality are so powerful that when the film works it hits them hard. how the society reacts at each point just makes me ashamed of my country and even though i haven't directly seen such situations or people i can't deny the probability of such occurrences. even though the subject is kind of

aliens that are not named coming to take control over it - by using sheer number and physical strength, obviously, a government that goes from hailing the x-men to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds. nothing makes any sense! the film connects to none of the previous films, has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesn't have them at all, in some cases. it's just a standalone x-men-like film that just doesn't seem to be part of the same thing. it looks like someone tried to make a mutant-x film and randomly got the rights for the x-men in the process. why was this done at all?\\\", \\\"maybe it had something to do with the fact phoenix came out so soon after endgame but all the negative feedback now more than a year later seems just a tad ott.\\\\nit worked on me. it actually has taken me until now to actually decide to finally give it a couple of hours of my time and i can honestly say 'wassup with all the fuss folks'!\\\\nsure it may not be the best marvel movie by quite a margin, not necessarily even the best x movie but did it warrant the criticism it recieved, hell no.\\\\ni found it an easy couple of hours and entertaining watch. did it have faults, sure. do plenty of other marvel movies also have faults, hell yes. did they receive the same level of criticism, hell no. bit of perspective required methinks peeps.\\\\njust my penny's worth.\\\", \\\"the storyline is pretty decent. but sophie turner's poor acting skills just kills the whole movie. rest of the characters are alright with the kind of script they have got. mcavoy and fassbender are more of a saving grace to this film.\\\", \\\"don't know where to start with this. if you're going to dig up the greatest story in the x-men canon, you need to bring it. and this film brought nothing. it all felt so hollow. the characters didn't ring true. the story didn't ring true. it was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout. i was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than i can put into words. this political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles.\\\", \\\"after reading the reviews today, i almost didn't go see dark phoenix. my wife and i both love the franchise, but the last few offerings have been pretty bad. but we chose to go anyway and we actually enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. i don't know why some people can't except a movie to be just entertainment. after the movie ended we both looked at each other and agreed that it was actually better than some of the previous marvel movies that received much higher ratings. please go and see it and you be your own judge.\\\", \\\"tackling the story arc of jean grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results, dark phoenix concludes the 20th century fox's x-men saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise. dull, predictable  utterly forgettable, it is as redundant as a sequel can get, and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all.\\\", \\\"i struggle to understand the terrible reviews. personally, i thought this was a solid watch. i could write a laundry list of things i loved or didn't love... but overall enjoyable.\\\", \\\"if you are a fan of the other x-men movies, you will definitely like dark phoenix. all the main characters do a good job, especially mcavoy, fassbender and sophie turner. i wasn't sure about sophie as jean, but she captured jean's turbulence well.\\\\nthe story barely follows the original dark phoenix, but it still does a good job finding its own way, and it touches on two or three impactful scenes from the original story, which helps connect it to the comic book version.\\\\nanother nice touch is that the fight scenes seem much more coordinated in this x-movie, it's not just random fighting. finally, the score and especially the sound effects were great. very immersive.\\\", \\\"this film ain't the best nor the worst, but it was below-average for me. like, i've seen worse. i would say the the only pros i could give about this movie would be the acting was good for the most part, the music done by hans zimmer was electrifying, and the 3rd act was the best part if the movie. but the rest is just blatant exposition, cringe-worthy dialogue, some wasted potential shown there.\\\\nbut like i said earlier, it ain't like fant4stic or the recent hellboy movie, but i would say it falls behind the disappointment that is x-men apocalypse.\\\", \\\"what a waste of talent of the a lister stars to play like a supporting roles for sophie turner just simply not workout. she's just like a wooden stick, flat and boring. about raven also not make any sense., so why should we care about all this characters at all then? story line seems to be rushing all the way, this is 2019 so i think the director insulting the audiences intelligent. i felt sad and angry after the film finished.\\\", 'good storyline and some good action scenes. started out slow, but got better']\",\n          \"[\\\"so we have a dystopian, coming soon future l.a. where inhabitants riot to get clean h2o. within it is a sanctuary of sorts where wmembership  following the rules you can reside in this sort of a hospital hotel secure from all that's going on in the streets. the nursedoctor runs the

spot narrative that goes exactly where you think it's gonna go. it's cool to look at, jodie foster and jeff goldblum are excellent despite their dull lines, and bautista's character is actually a lot of fun. but, 'hotel artemis' is definitely not the high-octane action-thriller it's being marketed as. the coolest action scene comes at the tail-end of the movie, which makes you wonder why they didn't do that kinda stuff the whole time.\\\", \\\"i won't say that the movie is a blockbuster material but itvwas fun to watch it. the concept is interestingly fresh and screenplay is gripping enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. good momentum.\\\", \\\"as a cinephile who prefers theatrical experiences over sitting at home, the movie is good enough to warrant that extra money. movies out are a chance to get away from it all, suspend any disbelief and go along for a ride that some truly creative folks built for us. this movie does a decent job of that. the hotel set itself is well resolved with just enough grunge tech mixed with sci-fi high end equipment i don't want to spoil anything to keep it fun to look at. it has a coen brothers barton fink fused with terry gilliam's brazil sort of feel. the original fixtures are art deco and then, with the decay of 'everything civilized', the building has been maintained only as needed to serve its purpose, its perfect. the beginning is well paced, you are introduced to the chaos of the outside world with just enough of a storyline to get you to the receiving doors of the hotel. characters all arrive on screen with an orderly almost metronome tempo, each with enough backstory development to keep you entertained. the set is complimented by the wardrobe design which is current and matches the roleplayers they adorn. characters anonymity is done in a slick way and we quickly understand membership and the rules of the day, some john wick echoes here and just as that is settled the main plot line kicks into gear. jodie foster plays her role effortlessly, perhaps too much so, it feels like there is some complex character development left on the editing room floor. she delivers though, and so do the others. bautista manages to shed typecast expectations. sofia boutella has grown as an actor and does a great job having lost her go-to bag of angry eye facial expressions, her action sequences are plausible which is refreshing given some of the incessantly over the top moves seen in other 2018 flicks. sterling k brown is perfect, goldblum too sheds his jurassic park trademark vocal style. all in all, the movie has the right ingredients to be fantastic. i recommend seeing it, absolutely, if you're a movie buff, see it on a big screen. where it under delivers is with the transition of fosters character being in control to everything going sideways. it happens too quickly. there is a lot more room left to develop disdain for the bad guys. it just sort of shifts from fairly tight to fairly predictable and it sort of methodically roles along winding down from there. it got my 7 of 10 for its finish, feel and editing, without that it would warrant maybe a six. better than average for the genre.\\\", \\\"maybe it's just me but i've not heard any buzz surrounding this movie and with the actors involved i figured it was due to its lackluster entertainment value. not only was i surprised, i thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and highly recommend it.\\\", \\\"didn't quite get it, a half-baked potato? sci-fi? two versions of blade runner? a hotel chain of john wick's used to go? l.a. riot for water usage? this hotel is such a ridiculous facility, fixing up the criminals only with futuristic medical devices, every room numbered with some tourist-trap name, the lock mechanism is so complicated, the entryentrance with reinforced steel gate, yet next to the gate is drywall, wtf? then the elevator is on its last leg, an antique. a bag of new and old crap putting together to give you a fuzzy idea of a mixed genre. there's only one nurse to fix all the out patient walk-ins. i have to ask the movie maker what are you trying to show and tell us? what's the point of making this crap? the storyline felt like a very weak patch-up pointless nonsense.\\\"]\",\n          \"['a beautiful movie with a strong message. akshay kumar hits a bullseye again and shines as a winner with his wonderful and effortless acting. he is lovable and takes the movie to the next level. the story as we all know is very inspiring but the execution is what makes it believable and entertaining. r balki has done a good job and the movie does not bore you even a bit. radhika aapte as always delivers a strong performance. sonam kapoor is fine and has performed better than all her previous movies. \\\\nhighly recommend everyone to watch this movie.', 'first and foremost a big round of applause to every single entity actors ,producers,director,writer,cameraman who are associated with this real life inspired piece of lifetime reality .\\\\nakshay kumar has acted flawlessly and setting another milestone for himself by acting as a rigid man who does not give up his dream even after multiple failures and malign and turns from a badman to padman.being a woman it was more easier to connect to each and every action of the protagonist such as testing the pad on his ownby pumping animal blood was the most touching scene which made me cry while watching.it gives me goosebumps while i think about the real hero mr lakshmikant.a jumbo hats off to him from the core of my heart and mind. rest all have also played their part very responsibly and successfully. \\\\nthis piece inspires to dream about every small and untouched but inevitable needs of life associated with human beingirrespective of caste creed and gender.\\\\ni will not go very far to proof this as i always wanted to write a review on movies and this is the movie which forced me to write the review right after coming back from theatre. though this story makes more sense to developing and underdeveloped countries like india where chums is still a taboo to talk about still the movie deserves a nomination for oscar in regional film category in the year of 2018.', \\\"r. balki cooked this dish with his own recipe alongside swanand kirkire, adding multiple flavors handpicked from balki's arsenal of trademark templates. pc sreeram's cinematography is god level for it does not have any kind of cutting edge cgi in it but has simple and subtle colours and excellent frames. the costumes, the art-work, and editing are definitely added assets to the film. amit trivedi's score is lively and suits balki's taste perfectly. of course, akshay kumar and radhika apte performed really well but the best surprise for me was sonam's character in this film. really had a touching moment at the very end. on a whole, its educating and entertaining.\\\", 'such a rare film ever.... great job by akshaykumar sonamkapoor rbalki !', \\\"padman, tells an important story in an engaging and entertaining way. i enjoyed this movie overall and really enjoyed akshay kumar's lead performance. his character is very likable has he only has the purest intentions to something good for society. the story was inspirational and pretty well put together. i do feel that the first half of the movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive and it probably could have been cut a bit shorter. the movie does bounce back with a fast-paced and resonant second half that makes the movie worthwhile. it's a good movie with a strong message and a good heart that i enjoyed.\\\", 'akshay is improving himself day by day...\\\\na very good motivational movie.you should watch.', \\\"with such important subjects each time akshay kumar is trying to be a socially committed actor but most of them always stay short of being really effective. here also the subject is important in the bigoted indian society but the execution is just ok. the film lacks proper focus and the issue is still not addressed properly keeping it taboo and only reachable to an extent. the narrative is not at all consistent and the first half drags so much without making any point. but the subject and its reality are so powerful that when the film works it hits them hard. how the society reacts at each point just makes me ashamed of my country and even though i haven't directly seen such situations or people i can't deny the probability of such occurrences. even though the subject is kind of approached superficially the importance and social effect of the film that can be felt through some of the moments in the film make it worth it.\\\", 'i watched it on friday, definitely it is wonderful movie.', 'the movie is good as the movie is basically made with social message in mind. as far as the movie changes stereotypes and changes in even a small way the thinking of society the effort needs to be appreciated. hats off for acting and direction. i had fun watching the movie.', \\\"akshay kumar's acting is great oh boy the casting was soo good and the story was original and shoutout to the team who decided to make this a film and show that a country is strong when the country's women are safe and strong such a great message and an inspiration.\\\", 'thanks to akshay kumar for saying yes for a movie on this subject.\\\\nit got all the attention because of akshay kumar.', \\\"this movie is amazing and inspiring. the plot takes too long to evolve, but that's ok!

something that is not named merging with jean grey aliens that are not named coming to take control over it by using sheer number and physical strength obviously a government that goes from hailing the xmen to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds nothing makes any sense the film connects to none of the previous films has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesnt have them at all in some cases its just a standalone xmenlike film that just doesnt seem to be part of the same thing it looks like someone tried to make a mutantx film and randomly got the rights for the xmen in the process why was this done at all maybe it had something to do with the fact phoenix came out so soon after endgame but all the negative feedback now more than a year later seems just a tad ottnit worked on me it actually has taken me until now to actually decide to finally give it a couple of hours of my time and i can honestly say wassup with all the fuss folksnsure it may not be the best marvel movie by quite a margin not necessarily even the best x movie but did it warrant the criticism it recieved hell noni found it an easy couple of hours and entertaining watch did it have faults sure do plenty of other marvel movies also have faults hell yes did they receive the same level of criticism hell no bit of perspective required methinks peepsnjust my pennys worth the storyline is pretty decent but sophie turners poor acting skills just kills the whole movie rest of the characters are alright with the kind of script they have got mcavoy and fassbender are more of a saving grace to this film dont know where to start with this if youre going to dig up the greatest story in the xmen canon you need to bring it and this film brought nothing it all felt so hollow the characters didnt ring true the story didnt ring true it was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout i was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than i can put into words this political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles after reading the reviews today i almost didnt go see dark phoenix my wife and i both love the franchise but the last few offerings have been pretty bad but we chose to go anyway and we actually enjoyed the movie from beginning to end i dont know why some people cant except a movie to be just entertainment after the movie ended we both looked at each other and agreed that it was actually better than some of the previous marvel movies that received much higher ratings please go and see it and you be your own judge tackling the story arc of jean grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results dark phoenix concludes the th century foxs xmen saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise dull predictable utterly forgettable it is as redundant as a sequel can get and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all i struggle to understand the terrible reviews personally i thought this was a solid watch i could write a laundry list of things i loved or didnt love but overall enjoyable if you are a fan of the other xmen movies you will definitely like dark phoenix all the main characters do a good job especially mcavoy fassbender and sophie turner i wasnt sure about sophie as jean but she captured jeans turbulence wellnthe story barely follows the original dark phoenix but it still does a good job finding its own way and it touches on two or three impactful scenes from the original story which helps connect it to the comic book versionnanother nice touch is that the fight scenes seem much more coordinated in this xmovie its not just random fighting finally the score and especially the sound effects were great very immersive this film aint the best nor the worst but it was belowaverage for me like ive seen worse i would say the the only pros i could give about this movie would be the acting was good for the most part the music done by hans zimmer was electrifying and the rd act was the best part if the movie but the rest is just blatant exposition cringeworthy dialogue some wasted potential shown therenbut like i said earlier it aint like fantstic or the recent hellboy movie but i would say it falls behind the disappointment that is xmen apocalypse what a waste of talent of the a lister stars to play like a supporting roles for sophie turner just simply not workout shes just like a wooden stick flat and boring about raven also not make any sense so why should we care about all this characters at all then story line seems to be rushing all the way this is so i think the director insulting the audiences intelligent i felt sad and angry after the film finished good storyline and some good action scenes started out slow but got better\",\n          \"so we have a dystopian coming soon future la where inhabitants riot to get

aliens that are not named coming to take control over it - by using sheer number and physical strength, obviously, a government that goes from hailing the x-men to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds. nothing makes any sense! the film connects to none of the previous films, has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesn't have them at all, in some cases. it's just a standalone x-men-like film that just doesn't seem to be part of the same thing. it looks like someone tried to make a mutant-x film and randomly got the rights for the x-men in the process. why was this done at all?\\\", \\\"maybe it had something to do with the fact phoenix came out so soon after endgame but all the negative feedback now more than a year later seems just a tad ott.\\\\nit worked on me. it actually has taken me until now to actually decide to finally give it a couple of hours of my time and i can honestly say 'wassup with all the fuss folks'!\\\\nsure it may not be the best marvel movie by quite a margin, not necessarily even the best x movie but did it warrant the criticism it recieved, hell no.\\\\ni found it an easy couple of hours and entertaining watch. did it have faults, sure. do plenty of other marvel movies also have faults, hell yes. did they receive the same level of criticism, hell no. bit of perspective required methinks peeps.\\\\njust my penny's worth.\\\", \\\"the storyline is pretty decent. but sophie turner's poor acting skills just kills the whole movie. rest of the characters are alright with the kind of script they have got. mcavoy and fassbender are more of a saving grace to this film.\\\", \\\"don't know where to start with this. if you're going to dig up the greatest story in the x-men canon, you need to bring it. and this film brought nothing. it all felt so hollow. the characters didn't ring true. the story didn't ring true. it was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout. i was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than i can put into words. this political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles.\\\", \\\"after reading the reviews today, i almost didn't go see dark phoenix. my wife and i both love the franchise, but the last few offerings have been pretty bad. but we chose to go anyway and we actually enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. i don't know why some people can't except a movie to be just entertainment. after the movie ended we both looked at each other and agreed that it was actually better than some of the previous marvel movies that received much higher ratings. please go and see it and you be your own judge.\\\", \\\"tackling the story arc of jean grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results, dark phoenix concludes the 20th century fox's x-men saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise. dull, predictable  utterly forgettable, it is as redundant as a sequel can get, and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all.\\\", \\\"i struggle to understand the terrible reviews. personally, i thought this was a solid watch. i could write a laundry list of things i loved or didn't love... but overall enjoyable.\\\", \\\"if you are a fan of the other x-men movies, you will definitely like dark phoenix. all the main characters do a good job, especially mcavoy, fassbender and sophie turner. i wasn't sure about sophie as jean, but she captured jean's turbulence well.\\\\nthe story barely follows the original dark phoenix, but it still does a good job finding its own way, and it touches on two or three impactful scenes from the original story, which helps connect it to the comic book version.\\\\nanother nice touch is that the fight scenes seem much more coordinated in this x-movie, it's not just random fighting. finally, the score and especially the sound effects were great. very immersive.\\\", \\\"this film ain't the best nor the worst, but it was below-average for me. like, i've seen worse. i would say the the only pros i could give about this movie would be the acting was good for the most part, the music done by hans zimmer was electrifying, and the 3rd act was the best part if the movie. but the rest is just blatant exposition, cringe-worthy dialogue, some wasted potential shown there.\\\\nbut like i said earlier, it ain't like fant4stic or the recent hellboy movie, but i would say it falls behind the disappointment that is x-men apocalypse.\\\", \\\"what a waste of talent of the a lister stars to play like a supporting roles for sophie turner just simply not workout. she's just like a wooden stick, flat and boring. about raven also not make any sense., so why should we care about all this characters at all then? story line seems to be rushing all the way, this is 2019 so i think the director insulting the audiences intelligent. i felt sad and angry after the film finished.\\\", 'good storyline and some good action scenes. started out slow, but got better']\",\n          \"[\\\"so we have a dystopian, coming soon future l.a. where inhabitants riot to get clean h2o. within it is a sanctuary of sorts where wmembership  following the rules you can reside in this sort of a hospital hotel secure from all that's going on in the streets. the nursedoctor runs the place wthe help of a big muscle guy, and robotic medical help. they face all sorts of not-so-nice characters. a bit of violence of course to add spice to the intrigue. script a bit scattered at times, but somewhat creative. acting interesting  different.\\\\nside note there's a scene with a body beneath a pier that is almost identical to a similar scene in breath.\\\", \\\"i really liked the premise of this --10 years in the future, a nurse runs a covert hospital for criminals in downtown l.a., but what you get is some run-of-the-mill heist gone wrong, gotta find a way outta this tight spot narrative that goes exactly where you think it's gonna go. it's cool to look at, jodie foster and jeff goldblum are excellent despite their dull lines, and bautista's character is actually a lot of fun. but, 'hotel artemis' is definitely not the high-octane action-thriller it's being marketed as. the coolest action scene comes at the tail-end of the movie, which makes you wonder why they didn't do that kinda stuff the whole time.\\\", \\\"i won't say that the movie is a blockbuster material but itvwas fun to watch it. the concept is interestingly fresh and screenplay is gripping enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. good momentum.\\\", \\\"as a cinephile who prefers theatrical experiences over sitting at home, the movie is good enough to warrant that extra money. movies out are a chance to get away from it all, suspend any disbelief and go along for a ride that some truly creative folks built for us. this movie does a decent job of that. the hotel set itself is well resolved with just enough grunge tech mixed with sci-fi high end equipment i don't want to spoil anything to keep it fun to look at. it has a coen brothers barton fink fused with terry gilliam's brazil sort of feel. the original fixtures are art deco and then, with the decay of 'everything civilized', the building has been maintained only as needed to serve its purpose, its perfect. the beginning is well paced, you are introduced to the chaos of the outside world with just enough of a storyline to get you to the receiving doors of the hotel. characters all arrive on screen with an orderly almost metronome tempo, each with enough backstory development to keep you entertained. the set is complimented by the wardrobe design which is current and matches the roleplayers they adorn. characters anonymity is done in a slick way and we quickly understand membership and the rules of the day, some john wick echoes here and just as that is settled the main plot line kicks into gear. jodie foster plays her role effortlessly, perhaps too much so, it feels like there is some complex character development left on the editing room floor. she delivers though, and so do the others. bautista manages to shed typecast expectations. sofia boutella has grown as an actor and does a great job having lost her go-to bag of angry eye facial expressions, her action sequences are plausible which is refreshing given some of the incessantly over the top moves seen in other 2018 flicks. sterling k brown is perfect, goldblum too sheds his jurassic park trademark vocal style. all in all, the movie has the right ingredients to be fantastic. i recommend seeing it, absolutely, if you're a movie buff, see it on a big screen. where it under delivers is with the transition of fosters character being in control to everything going sideways. it happens too quickly. there is a lot more room left to develop disdain for the bad guys. it just sort of shifts from fairly tight to fairly predictable and it sort of methodically roles along winding down from there. it got my 7 of 10 for its finish, feel and editing, without that it would warrant maybe a six. better than average for the genre.\\\", \\\"maybe it's just me but i've not heard any buzz surrounding this movie and with the actors involved i figured it was due to its lackluster entertainment value. not only was i surprised, i thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and highly recommend it.\\\", \\\"didn't quite get it, a half-baked potato? sci-fi? two versions of blade runner? a hotel chain of john wick's used to go? l.a. riot for water usage? this hotel is such a ridiculous facility, fixing up the criminals only with futuristic medical devices, every room numbered with some tourist-trap name, the lock mechanism is so complicated, the entryentrance with reinforced steel gate, yet next to the gate is drywall, wtf? then the elevator is on its last leg, an antique. a bag of new and old crap putting together to give you a fuzzy idea of a mixed genre. there's only one nurse to fix all the out patient walk-ins. i have to ask the movie maker what are you trying to show and tell us? what's the point of making this crap? the storyline felt like a very weak patch-up pointless nonsense.\\\"]\",\n          \"['a beautiful movie with a strong message. akshay kumar hits a bullseye again and shines as a winner with his wonderful and effortless acting. he is lovable and takes the movie to the next level. the story as we all know is very inspiring but the execution is what makes it believable and entertaining. r balki has done a good job and the movie does not bore you even a bit. radhika aapte as always delivers a strong performance. sonam kapoor is fine and has performed better than all her previous movies. \\\\nhighly recommend everyone to watch this movie.', 'first and foremost a big round of applause to every single entity actors ,producers,director,writer,cameraman who are associated with this real life inspired piece of lifetime reality .\\\\nakshay kumar has acted flawlessly and setting another milestone for himself by acting as a rigid man who does not give up his dream even after multiple failures and malign and turns from a badman to padman.being a woman it was more easier to connect to each and every action of the protagonist such as testing the pad on his ownby pumping animal blood was the most touching scene which made me cry while watching.it gives me goosebumps while i think about the real hero mr lakshmikant.a jumbo hats off to him from the core of my heart and mind. rest all have also played their part very responsibly and successfully. \\\\nthis piece inspires to dream about every small and untouched but inevitable needs of life associated with human beingirrespective of caste creed and gender.\\\\ni will not go very far to proof this as i always wanted to write a review on movies and this is the movie which forced me to write the review right after coming back from theatre. though this story makes more sense to developing and underdeveloped countries like india where chums is still a taboo to talk about still the movie deserves a nomination for oscar in regional film category in the year of 2018.', \\\"r. balki cooked this dish with his own recipe alongside swanand kirkire, adding multiple flavors handpicked from balki's arsenal of trademark templates. pc sreeram's cinematography is god level for it does not have any kind of cutting edge cgi in it but has simple and subtle colours and excellent frames. the costumes, the art-work, and editing are definitely added assets to the film. amit trivedi's score is lively and suits balki's taste perfectly. of course, akshay kumar and radhika apte performed really well but the best surprise for me was sonam's character in this film. really had a touching moment at the very end. on a whole, its educating and entertaining.\\\", 'such a rare film ever.... great job by akshaykumar sonamkapoor rbalki !', \\\"padman, tells an important story in an engaging and entertaining way. i enjoyed this movie overall and really enjoyed akshay kumar's lead performance. his character is very likable has he only has the purest intentions to something good for society. the story was inspirational and pretty well put together. i do feel that the first half of the movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive and it probably could have been cut a bit shorter. the movie does bounce back with a fast-paced and resonant second half that makes the movie worthwhile. it's a good movie with a strong message and a good heart that i enjoyed.\\\", 'akshay is improving himself day by day...\\\\na very good motivational movie.you should watch.', \\\"with such important subjects each time akshay kumar is trying to be a socially committed actor but most of them always stay short of being really effective. here also the subject is important in the bigoted indian society but the execution is just ok. the film lacks proper focus and the issue is still not addressed properly keeping it taboo and only reachable to an extent. the narrative is not at all consistent and the first half drags so much without making any point. but the subject and its reality are so powerful that when the film works it hits them hard. how the society reacts at each point just makes me ashamed of my country and even though i haven't directly seen such situations or people i can't deny the probability of such occurrences. even though the subject is kind of approached superficially the importance and social effect of the film that can be felt through some of the moments in the film make it worth it.\\\", 'i watched it on friday, definitely it is wonderful movie.', 'the movie is good as the movie is basically made with social message in mind. as far as the movie changes stereotypes and changes in even a small way the thinking of society the effort needs to be appreciated. hats off for acting and direction. i had fun watching the movie.', \\\"akshay kumar's acting is great oh boy the casting was soo good and the story was original and shoutout to the team who decided to make this a film and show that a country is strong when the country's women are safe and strong such a great message and an inspiration.\\\", 'thanks to akshay

something that is not named merging with jean grey aliens that are not named coming to take control over it by using sheer number and physical strength obviously a government that goes from hailing the xmen to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds nothing makes any sense the film connects to none of the previous films has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesnt have them at all in some cases its just a standalone xmenlike film that just doesnt seem to be part of the same thing it looks like someone tried to make a mutantx film and randomly got the rights for the xmen in the process why was this done at all maybe it had something to do with the fact phoenix came out so soon after endgame but all the negative feedback now more than a year later seems just a tad ottnit worked on me it actually has taken me until now to actually decide to finally give it a couple of hours of my time and i can honestly say wassup with all the fuss folksnsure it may not be the best marvel movie by quite a margin not necessarily even the best x movie but did it warrant the criticism it recieved hell noni found it an easy couple of hours and entertaining watch did it have faults sure do plenty of other marvel movies also have faults hell yes did they receive the same level of criticism hell no bit of perspective required methinks peepsnjust my pennys worth the storyline is pretty decent but sophie turners poor acting skills just kills the whole movie rest of the characters are alright with the kind of script they have got mcavoy and fassbender are more of a saving grace to this film dont know where to start with this if youre going to dig up the greatest story in the xmen canon you need to bring it and this film brought nothing it all felt so hollow the characters didnt ring true the story didnt ring true it was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout i was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than i can put into words this political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles after reading the reviews today i almost didnt go see dark phoenix my wife and i both love the franchise but the last few offerings have been pretty bad but we chose to go anyway and we actually enjoyed the movie from beginning to end i dont know why some people cant except a movie to be just entertainment after the movie ended we both looked at each other and agreed that it was actually better than some of the previous marvel movies that received much higher ratings please go and see it and you be your own judge tackling the story arc of jean grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results dark phoenix concludes the th century foxs xmen saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise dull predictable utterly forgettable it is as redundant as a sequel can get and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all i struggle to understand the terrible reviews personally i thought this was a solid watch i could write a laundry list of things i loved or didnt love but overall enjoyable if you are a fan of the other xmen movies you will definitely like dark phoenix all the main characters do a good job especially mcavoy fassbender and sophie turner i wasnt sure about sophie as jean but she captured jeans turbulence wellnthe story barely follows the original dark phoenix but it still does a good job finding its own way and it touches on two or three impactful scenes from the original story which helps connect it to the comic book versionnanother nice touch is that the fight scenes seem much more coordinated in this xmovie its not just random fighting finally the score and especially the sound effects were great very immersive this film aint the best nor the worst but it was belowaverage for me like ive seen worse i would say the the only pros i could give about this movie would be the acting was good for the most part the music done by hans zimmer was electrifying and the rd act was the best part if the movie but the rest is just blatant exposition cringeworthy dialogue some wasted potential shown therenbut like i said earlier it aint like fantstic or the recent hellboy movie but i would say it falls behind the disappointment that is xmen apocalypse what a waste of talent of the a lister stars to play like a supporting roles for sophie turner just simply not workout shes just like a wooden stick flat and boring about raven also not make any sense so why should we care about all this characters at all then story line seems to be rushing all the way this is so i think the director insulting the audiences intelligent i felt sad and angry after the film finished good storyline and some good action scenes started out slow but got better\",\n          \"so we have a dystopian coming soon future la where inhabitants riot to get

are not named coming to take control over it by using sheer number and physical strength obviously a government that goes from hailing the xmen to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds nothing makes any sense the film connects to none of the previous films has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesnt have them at all in some cases its just a standalone xmenlike film that just doesnt seem to be part of the same thing it looks like someone tried to make a mutantx film and randomly got the rights for the xmen in the process why was this done at all maybe it had something to do with the fact phoenix came out so soon after endgame but all the negative feedback now more than a year later seems just a tad ottnit worked on me it actually has taken me until now to actually decide to finally give it a couple of hours of my time and i can honestly say wassup with all the fuss folksnsure it may not be the best marvel movie by quite a margin not necessarily even the best x movie but did it warrant the criticism it recieved hell noni found it an easy couple of hours and entertaining watch did it have faults sure do plenty of other marvel movies also have faults hell yes did they receive the same level of criticism hell no bit of perspective required methinks peepsnjust my pennys worth the storyline is pretty decent but sophie turners poor acting skills just kills the whole movie rest of the characters are alright with the kind of script they have got mcavoy and fassbender are more of a saving grace to this film dont know where to start with this if youre going to dig up the greatest story in the xmen canon you need to bring it and this film brought nothing it all felt so hollow the characters didnt ring true the story didnt ring true it was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout i was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than i can put into words this political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles after reading the reviews today i almost didnt go see dark phoenix my wife and i both love the franchise but the last few offerings have been pretty bad but we chose to go anyway and we actually enjoyed the movie from beginning to end i dont know why some people cant except a movie to be just entertainment after the movie ended we both looked at each other and agreed that it was actually better than some of the previous marvel movies that received much higher ratings please go and see it and you be your own judge tackling the story arc of jean grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results dark phoenix concludes the th century foxs xmen saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise dull predictable utterly forgettable it is as redundant as a sequel can get and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all i struggle to understand the terrible reviews personally i thought this was a solid watch i could write a laundry list of things i loved or didnt love but overall enjoyable if you are a fan of the other xmen movies you will definitely like dark phoenix all the main characters do a good job especially mcavoy fassbender and sophie turner i wasnt sure about sophie as jean but she captured jeans turbulence wellnthe story barely follows the original dark phoenix but it still does a good job finding its own way and it touches on two or three impactful scenes from the original story which helps connect it to the comic book versionnanother nice touch is that the fight scenes seem much more coordinated in this xmovie its not just random fighting finally the score and especially the sound effects were great very immersive this film aint the best nor the worst but it was belowaverage for me like ive seen worse i would say the the only pros i could give about this movie would be the acting was good for the most part the music done by hans zimmer was electrifying and the rd act was the best part if the movie but the rest is just blatant exposition cringeworthy dialogue some wasted potential shown therenbut like i said earlier it aint like fantstic or the recent hellboy movie but i would say it falls behind the disappointment that is xmen apocalypse what a waste of talent of the a lister stars to play like a supporting roles for sophie turner just simply not workout shes just like a wooden stick flat and boring about raven also not make any sense so why should we care about all this characters at all then story line seems to be rushing all the way this is so i think the director insulting the audiences intelligent i felt sad and angry after the film finished good storyline and some good action scenes started out slow but got better\",\n          \"so we have a dystopian coming soon future la where inhabitants riot to get clean ho within it is a sanctuary of sorts where wmembership following

all sorts of notsonice characters a bit of violence of course to add spice to the intrigue script a bit scattered at times but somewhat creative acting interesting differentnside note theres a scene with a body beneath a pier that is almost identical to a similar scene in breath i really liked the premise of this years in the future a nurse runs a covert hospital for criminals in downtown la but what you get is some runofthemill heist gone wrong gotta find a way outta this tight spot narrative that goes exactly where you think its gonna go its cool to look at jodie foster and jeff goldblum are excellent despite their dull lines and bautistas character is actually a lot of fun but hotel artemis is definitely not the highoctane actionthriller its being marketed as the coolest action scene comes at the tailend of the movie which makes you wonder why they didnt do that kinda stuff the whole time i wont say that the movie is a blockbuster material but itvwas fun to watch it the concept is interestingly fresh and screenplay is gripping enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seats good momentum as a cinephile who prefers theatrical experiences over sitting at home the movie is good enough to warrant that extra money movies out are a chance to get away from it all suspend any disbelief and go along for a ride that some truly creative folks built for us this movie does a decent job of that the hotel set itself is well resolved with just enough grunge tech mixed with scifi high end equipment i dont want to spoil anything to keep it fun to look at it has a coen brothers barton fink fused with terry gilliams brazil sort of feel the original fixtures are art deco and then with the decay of everything civilized the building has been maintained only as needed to serve its purpose its perfect the beginning is well paced you are introduced to the chaos of the outside world with just enough of a storyline to get you to the receiving doors of the hotel characters all arrive on screen with an orderly almost metronome tempo each with enough backstory development to keep you entertained the set is complimented by the wardrobe design which is current and matches the roleplayers they adorn characters anonymity is done in a slick way and we quickly understand membership and the rules of the day some john wick echoes here and just as that is settled the main plot line kicks into gear jodie foster plays her role effortlessly perhaps too much so it feels like there is some complex character development left on the editing room floor she delivers though and so do the others bautista manages to shed typecast expectations sofia boutella has grown as an actor and does a great job having lost her goto bag of angry eye facial expressions her action sequences are plausible which is refreshing given some of the incessantly over the top moves seen in other flicks sterling k brown is perfect goldblum too sheds his jurassic park trademark vocal style all in all the movie has the right ingredients to be fantastic i recommend seeing it absolutely if youre a movie buff see it on a big screen where it under delivers is with the transition of fosters character being in control to everything going sideways it happens too quickly there is a lot more room left to develop disdain for the bad guys it just sort of shifts from fairly tight to fairly predictable and it sort of methodically roles along winding down from there it got my of for its finish feel and editing without that it would warrant maybe a six better than average for the genre maybe its just me but ive not heard any buzz surrounding this movie and with the actors involved i figured it was due to its lackluster entertainment value not only was i surprised i thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and highly recommend it didnt quite get it a halfbaked potato scifi two versions of blade runner a hotel chain of john wicks used to go la riot for water usage this hotel is such a ridiculous facility fixing up the criminals only with futuristic medical devices every room numbered with some touristtrap name the lock mechanism is so complicated the entryentrance with reinforced steel gate yet next to the gate is drywall wtf then the elevator is on its last leg an antique a bag of new and old crap putting together to give you a fuzzy idea of a mixed genre theres only one nurse to fix all the out patient walkins i have to ask the movie maker what are you trying to show and tell us whats the point of making this crap the storyline felt like a very weak patchup pointless nonsense\",\n          \"a beautiful movie with a strong message akshay kumar hits a bullseye again and shines as a winner with his wonderful and effortless acting he is lovable and takes the movie to the next level the story as we all know is very inspiring but the execution is what makes it believable and entertaining r balki has done a good job and the movie does not bore you even a bit radhika aapte as always delivers a strong performance sonam kapoor is fine and has performed better than all her previous movies nhighly recommend everyone to watch this movie first and foremost a big round of applause to every single entity actors producersdirectorwritercameraman who are associated with this real life inspired piece of lifetime reality nakshay kumar has acted flawlessly and setting another milestone for himself by acting as a rigid man who does not give up his dream even after multiple failures and malign and turns from a badman to padmanbeing a woman it was more easier to connect to each and every action of the protagonist such as testing the pad on his ownby pumping animal blood was the most touching scene which made me cry while watchingit gives me goosebumps while i think about the real hero mr lakshmikanta jumbo hats off to him from the core of my heart and mind rest all have also played their part very responsibly and successfully nthis piece inspires to dream about every small and untouched but inevitable needs of life associated with human beingirrespective of caste creed and genderni will not go very far to proof this as i always wanted to write a review on movies and this is the movie which forced me to write the review right after coming back from theatre though this story makes more sense to developing and underdeveloped countries like india where chums is still a taboo to talk about still the movie deserves a nomination for oscar in regional film category in the year of r balki cooked this dish with his own recipe alongside swanand kirkire adding multiple flavors handpicked from balkis arsenal of trademark templates pc sreerams cinematography is god level for it does not have any kind of cutting edge cgi in it but has simple and subtle colours and excellent frames the costumes the artwork and editing are definitely added assets to the film amit trivedis score is lively and suits balkis taste perfectly of course akshay kumar and radhika apte performed really well but the best surprise for me was sonams character in this film really had a touching moment at the very end on a whole its educating and entertaining such a rare film ever great job by akshaykumar sonamkapoor rbalki padman tells an important story in an engaging and entertaining way i enjoyed this movie overall and really enjoyed akshay kumars lead performance his character is very likable has he only has the purest intentions to something good for society the story was inspirational and pretty well put together i do feel that the first half of the movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive and it probably could have been cut a bit shorter the movie does bounce back with a fastpaced and resonant second half that makes the movie worthwhile its a good movie with a strong message and a good heart that i enjoyed akshay is improving himself day by dayna very good motivational movieyou should watch with such important subjects each time akshay kumar is trying to be a socially committed actor but most of them always stay short of being really effective here also the subject is important in the bigoted indian society but the execution is just ok the film lacks proper focus and the issue is still not addressed properly keeping it taboo and only reachable to an extent the narrative is not at all consistent and the first half drags so much without making any point but the subject and its reality are so powerful that when the film works it hits them hard how the society reacts at each point just makes me ashamed of my country and even though i havent directly seen such situations or people i cant deny the probability of such occurrences even though the subject is kind of approached superficially the importance and social effect of the film that can be felt through some of the moments in the film make it worth it i watched it on friday definitely it is wonderful movie the movie is good as the movie is basically made with social message in mind as far as the movie changes stereotypes and changes in even a small way the thinking of society the effort needs to be appreciated hats off for acting and direction i had fun watching the movie akshay kumars acting is great oh boy the casting was soo good and the story was original and shoutout to the team who decided to make this a film and show that a country is strong when the countrys women are safe and strong such a great message and an inspiration thanks to akshay kumar for saying yes for a movie on this subjectnit got all the attention because of akshay kumar this movie is amazing and inspiring the plot takes too long to evolve but thats ok excellent movie to watch during this pandemic\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

are not named coming to take control over it by using sheer number and physical strength obviously a government that goes from hailing the xmen to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds nothing makes any sense the film connects to none of the previous films has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesnt have them at all in some cases its just a standalone xmenlike film that just doesnt seem to be part of the same thing it looks like someone tried to make a mutantx film and randomly got the rights for the xmen in the process why was this done at all maybe it had something to do with the fact phoenix came out so soon after endgame but all the negative feedback now more than a year later seems just a tad ottnit worked on me it actually has taken me until now to actually decide to finally give it a couple of hours of my time and i can honestly say wassup with all the fuss folksnsure it may not be the best marvel movie by quite a margin not necessarily even the best x movie but did it warrant the criticism it recieved hell noni found it an easy couple of hours and entertaining watch did it have faults sure do plenty of other marvel movies also have faults hell yes did they receive the same level of criticism hell no bit of perspective required methinks peepsnjust my pennys worth the storyline is pretty decent but sophie turners poor acting skills just kills the whole movie rest of the characters are alright with the kind of script they have got mcavoy and fassbender are more of a saving grace to this film dont know where to start with this if youre going to dig up the greatest story in the xmen canon you need to bring it and this film brought nothing it all felt so hollow the characters didnt ring true the story didnt ring true it was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout i was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than i can put into words this political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles after reading the reviews today i almost didnt go see dark phoenix my wife and i both love the franchise but the last few offerings have been pretty bad but we chose to go anyway and we actually enjoyed the movie from beginning to end i dont know why some people cant except a movie to be just entertainment after the movie ended we both looked at each other and agreed that it was actually better than some of the previous marvel movies that received much higher ratings please go and see it and you be your own judge tackling the story arc of jean grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results dark phoenix concludes the th century foxs xmen saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise dull predictable utterly forgettable it is as redundant as a sequel can get and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all i struggle to understand the terrible reviews personally i thought this was a solid watch i could write a laundry list of things i loved or didnt love but overall enjoyable if you are a fan of the other xmen movies you will definitely like dark phoenix all the main characters do a good job especially mcavoy fassbender and sophie turner i wasnt sure about sophie as jean but she captured jeans turbulence wellnthe story barely follows the original dark phoenix but it still does a good job finding its own way and it touches on two or three impactful scenes from the original story which helps connect it to the comic book versionnanother nice touch is that the fight scenes seem much more coordinated in this xmovie its not just random fighting finally the score and especially the sound effects were great very immersive this film aint the best nor the worst but it was belowaverage for me like ive seen worse i would say the the only pros i could give about this movie would be the acting was good for the most part the music done by hans zimmer was electrifying and the rd act was the best part if the movie but the rest is just blatant exposition cringeworthy dialogue some wasted potential shown therenbut like i said earlier it aint like fantstic or the recent hellboy movie but i would say it falls behind the disappointment that is xmen apocalypse what a waste of talent of the a lister stars to play like a supporting roles for sophie turner just simply not workout shes just like a wooden stick flat and boring about raven also not make any sense so why should we care about all this characters at all then story line seems to be rushing all the way this is so i think the director insulting the audiences intelligent i felt sad and angry after the film finished good storyline and some good action scenes started out slow but got better\",\n          \"so we have a dystopian coming soon future la where inhabitants riot to get clean ho within it is a sanctuary of sorts where wmembership following the rules you can reside in this sort of a hospital hotel secure from all thats going on in the streets the nursedoctor runs the place wthe help of a big muscle guy and robotic medical help they face all sorts of notsonice characters a bit of violence of course to add spice to the intrigue script a bit scattered at times but somewhat creative acting interesting differentnside note theres a scene with a body beneath a pier that is almost identical to a similar scene in breath i really liked the premise of this years in the future a nurse runs a covert hospital for criminals in downtown la but what you get is some runofthemill heist gone wrong gotta find a way outta this tight spot narrative that goes exactly where you think its gonna go its cool to look at jodie foster and jeff goldblum are excellent despite their dull lines and bautistas character is actually a lot of fun but hotel artemis is definitely not the highoctane actionthriller its being marketed as the coolest action scene comes at the tailend of the movie which makes you wonder why they didnt do that kinda stuff the whole time i wont say that the movie is a blockbuster material but itvwas fun to watch it the concept is interestingly fresh and screenplay is gripping enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seats good momentum as a cinephile who prefers theatrical experiences over sitting at home the movie is good enough to warrant that extra money movies out are a chance to get away from it all suspend any disbelief and go along for a ride that some truly creative folks built for us this movie does a decent job of that the hotel set itself is well resolved with just enough grunge tech mixed with scifi high end equipment i dont want to spoil anything to keep it fun to look at it has a coen brothers barton fink fused with terry gilliams brazil sort of feel the original fixtures are art deco and then with the decay of everything civilized the building has been maintained only as needed to serve its purpose its perfect the beginning is well paced you are introduced to the chaos of the outside world with just enough of a storyline to get you to the receiving doors of the hotel characters all arrive on screen with an orderly almost metronome tempo each with enough backstory development to keep you entertained the set is complimented by the wardrobe design which is current and matches the roleplayers they adorn characters anonymity is done in a slick way and we quickly understand membership and the rules of the day some john wick echoes here and just as that is settled the main plot line kicks into gear jodie foster plays her role effortlessly perhaps too much so it feels like there is some complex character development left on the editing room floor she delivers though and so do the others bautista manages to shed typecast expectations sofia boutella has grown as an actor and does a great job having lost her goto bag of angry eye facial expressions her action sequences are plausible which is refreshing given some of the incessantly over the top moves seen in other flicks sterling k brown is perfect goldblum too sheds his jurassic park trademark vocal style all in all the movie has the right ingredients to be fantastic i recommend seeing it absolutely if youre a movie buff see it on a big screen where it under delivers is with the transition of fosters character being in control to everything going sideways it happens too quickly there is a lot more room left to develop disdain for the bad guys it just sort of shifts from fairly tight to fairly predictable and it sort of methodically roles along winding down from there it got my of for its finish feel and editing without that it would warrant maybe a six better than average for the genre maybe its just me but ive not heard any buzz surrounding this movie and with the actors involved i figured it was due to its lackluster entertainment value not only was i surprised i thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and highly recommend it didnt quite get it a halfbaked potato scifi two versions of blade runner a hotel chain of john wicks used to go la riot for water usage this hotel is such a ridiculous facility fixing up the criminals only with futuristic medical devices every room numbered with some touristtrap name the lock mechanism is so complicated the entryentrance with reinforced steel gate yet next to the gate is drywall wtf then the elevator is on its last leg an antique a bag of new and old crap putting together to give you a fuzzy idea of a mixed genre theres only one nurse to fix all the out patient walkins i have to ask the movie maker what are you trying to show and tell us whats the point of making this crap the storyline felt like a very weak patchup pointless nonsense\",\n          \"a beautiful movie with a strong message akshay kumar hits a bullseye again and shines as a winner with his wonderful and effortless acting he is lovable and takes the movie to the next level the story as we all know is very inspiring but the execution is what makes it believable and entertaining r balki has done a good job and the movie does not bore you even a bit radhika aapte as always delivers a strong performance sonam kapoor is fine and has performed better than all her previous movies nhighly recommend everyone to watch this movie first and foremost a big round of applause to every single entity actors producersdirectorwritercameraman who are associated with this real life inspired piece of lifetime reality nakshay kumar has acted flawlessly and setting another milestone for himself by acting as a rigid man who does not give up his dream even after multiple failures and malign and turns from a badman to padmanbeing a woman it was more easier to connect to each and every action of the protagonist such as testing the pad on his ownby pumping animal blood was the most touching scene which made me cry while watchingit gives me goosebumps while i think about the real hero mr lakshmikanta jumbo hats off to him from the core of my heart and mind rest all have also played their part very responsibly and successfully nthis piece inspires to dream about every small and untouched but inevitable needs of life associated with human beingirrespective of caste creed and genderni will not go very far to proof this as i always wanted to write a review on movies and this is the movie which forced me to write the review right after coming back from theatre though this story makes more sense to developing and underdeveloped countries like india where chums is still a taboo to talk about still the movie deserves a nomination for oscar in regional film category in the year of r balki cooked this dish with his own recipe alongside swanand kirkire adding multiple flavors handpicked from balkis arsenal of trademark templates pc sreerams cinematography is god level for it does not have any kind of cutting edge cgi in it but has simple and subtle colours and excellent frames the costumes the artwork and editing are definitely added assets to the film amit trivedis score is lively and suits balkis taste perfectly of course akshay kumar and radhika apte performed really well but the best surprise for me was sonams character in this film really had a touching moment at the very end on a whole its educating and entertaining such a rare film ever great job by akshaykumar sonamkapoor rbalki padman tells an important story in an engaging and entertaining way i enjoyed this movie overall and really enjoyed akshay kumars lead performance his character is very likable has he only has the purest intentions to something good for society the story was inspirational and pretty well put together i do feel that the first half of the movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive and it probably could have been cut a bit shorter the movie does bounce back with a fastpaced and resonant second half that makes the movie worthwhile its a good movie with a strong message and a good heart that i enjoyed akshay is improving himself day by dayna very good motivational movieyou should watch with such important subjects each time akshay kumar is trying to be a socially committed actor but most of them always stay short of being really effective here also the subject is important in the bigoted indian society but the execution is just ok the film lacks proper focus and the issue is still not addressed properly keeping it taboo and only reachable to an extent the narrative is not at all consistent and the first half drags so much without making any point but the subject and its reality are so powerful that when the film works it hits them hard how the society reacts at each point just makes me ashamed of my country and even though i havent directly seen such situations or people i cant deny the probability of such occurrences even though the subject is kind of approached superficially the importance and social effect of the film that can be felt through some of the moments in the film make it worth it i watched it on friday definitely it is wonderful movie the movie is good as the movie is basically made with social message in mind as far as the movie changes stereotypes and changes in even a small way the thinking of society the effort needs to be appreciated hats off for acting and direction i had fun watching the movie akshay kumars acting is great oh boy the casting was soo good and the story was original and shoutout to the team who decided to make this a film and show that a country is strong when the countrys women are safe and strong such a great message and an inspiration thanks to akshay kumar for saying yes for a movie on this subjectnit got all the attention because of akshay kumar this movie is amazing and inspiring the plot takes too long to evolve but thats ok excellent movie to watch during this pandemic\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
