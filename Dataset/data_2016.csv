but the plot didn't know where it was going. a lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and i got goosebumps watching them. there was more to jesse eisenberg than what i saw and hated, like most people in the trailer. i made a bet to my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess i'll have to pay up. he really was good. but just like any other movie, it's not perfect and has flaws. you can see that zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. other than that, i think there are some fan-boys who'll be satisfied no matter how bad the movie is. hope my review didn't give away any spoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movie as much as or more than i did."", ""this is movie is the definition of perfection in every aspect . to break the characters and then build them up in the climax is the most satisfying thing to do . i have watched this movie 20 times and still not satisfied . with every frame created with so much passion , the story that builds with not only characters but also the surroundings . there is a line in this movie which sums up everything related to this movie  you hate what you don't understand."", ""if you don't know the comics then it seems you won't understand this great flick. this film does the source material proper for a change which is great to see. yes it's a mix of a bunch of story lines but it was done in great fashion. are there a few issues, sure, no movie is perfect but at the end of the day those that don't like it, aren't true fans and don't know the backstories here. can't wait til they restorethesnyderverse !""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJkYjdmYjYtOGMyNC00ZGU1LThkY2ItYTc1OTVlMmE2YWY1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Batman is manipulated by Lex Luthor to fear Superman.

no, definietly not. there are a few flaws, which i'll talk about later. with that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. the plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. the characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. the movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. i love that despite obviously wanting us to side with cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the correct one. both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the avengers should do. the new characters such as black panther and spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. all this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. the direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in winter soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. and, while it might not be a big deal, man was it good to see a truly great antagonist in zemo. he's well written and very well played by daniel brühl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the mcu has done before. with that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. the movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. it feels like cap and stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things i could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. it's a more mature take on the marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it."", ""hi,  i saw civil war and i come with good news it's awesome!  im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by  only the two trailers you probably saw. don't watch any tvspots after  the second trailer or whatever!  im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.  acting of course it's amazing. the characters we were waiting for were  black panther and of course spiderman! both were done amazing!  spiderman has a bigger role than i personally expected and it's done  with grace. love it. black panther was such a good character with great  motivation why he's doing what he's doing. the acting per usual from  the other characters were great! 1010  story now where another let's leave it unnamed superhero movie  failed this year, and no i'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the  story. now this story is what i expected from the other unnamed  superhero movie. i didn't know what side i wanted to be on cap's or  iron man's. i was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you  don't know who to root for. the villain in this movie felt a bit, not  really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. but marvel always  struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for loki  kingpin  in the series. 810   actioncinematography o boy..if you're an action freak you will love  this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna live these amazing  action set pieces. the much anticipated airport scene is amazing.  you've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will  bestow upon you guys. the airport scene is in complete imax and has a  runtime of around 17 minutes. just let that sink in! the russo brothers  know how to create great action and film it great as well. i can go on  record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever.  2010.   verdict was it a perfect movie? no. but for me as a fan it came darn  close. the only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually  one of the few that are in there.   was it better than... batman v superman.. yes by far. i mean we're in a  comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. batman v  superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better.  just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the  characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now  after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes  are so incredibly high. i tried to compare dead-pool with it as well,  but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and  setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and  good instead of good and evil.   9 out of 10! near perfect movie for the fans9.5 and a good solid  action film for the general movie go-ers9"", ""i loved every second of captain america civil war. everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly. this movie is everything batman v. superman should've been. every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. in my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was spider-man and black panther. they got both of these characters right especially black panther. as much as i loved batman v. superman, i have to give this movie more credit. the russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. this movie was very good and i plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times! this movie made me very excited to see what comes next in the mcu."", 'one of the best marvel movies,great character development,good storyline\na great answer to the question  how will the governments of today act if superheroes existed?', ""checkmate, haters. and sorry, it's just not your year. i have seen this movie, but i won't mention a single spoiler here. if you guys want proof, you can pm me and i'll tell you how the movie ends and the after credits. the reason i'm really writing this review is that i know there will be biased people here who'll write that bvs is better and this is trash, etc, etc. well, just see this movie and judge for yourself. speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. spidey had a satisfying screen time. as for the acting, by the time the movie ended, i was a happy man. russov's are handling infinity war, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, i'll not worry. a movie we wanted as well as deserve.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MTgyNjAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUzMDkyODE@._V1_.jpg,Political involvement in the Avengers' affairs causes a rift between Captain America and Iron Man.

godzilla ultimately steals the show, and you'd hope so from a godzilla movie. the visuals at times can be shoddy, but in the scenes where the lighting is just right, it's a glorious moment to behold truly horrifying visuals in a good way. the plot, however, is where it kind of suffers the most for me."", ""this movie explodes with awesomeness, realism, and entertainment. it is a spectacle from start to finish and makes for a great midnight movie. there are lots of conversations and dialogue in this movie but to me it wasn't too much. some of the best movies are dialogue driven with little happening elsewhere. this movie gives us the best of both worlds with great characters and convos as well as epic action and monster sequences. there are many characters and honestly there are too many but it's okay because we don't have to really get to know these characters. they aren't there for us to be connected deeply or emotionally with. they're simply there to act as the ants frantically planning and plotting in their finely put together civilization while a human comes stomping through their world. its a great comparison to see the humans going against godzilla. more so than any newer godzilla film and maybe any of them all together."", ""another reboot in the long-running japanese franchise that has contained actors in giant rubber costumes decimating cities and brawling with each other amidst chaotic infernos. all of those aspects have been incinerated in anno's instalment, who substitutes typical kaiju destruction with bureaucracy and satirical politics. the result is a sublime resurgence of the titular god incarnate. a colossal beast rises from the sea and starts destroying japanese cities where the government must form a plan to prevent further destruction. the complexity of japan's bureaucratic system is fully explored, with several organisations and administrations not taking ownership of the situation. the satirical nature of the narrative acts as a metaphor for recent disasters such as fukushima and tõhoku whilst also reflecting on nagasaki and hiroshima. the creature itself acts as galavanting nuclear reactor, leaving radiation in its wake. the interjectory catastrophes within the politically charged perspective surprisingly makes for a captivating watch. suddenly the entire situation feels real, with economic struggles and urban evacuation rapidly taking place. yet, patriotic optimism is nested deep within the story, with japanese officials wanting the best for their country. this means relying on other nations for assistance, where any past relationships have been put aside for the greater good. godzilla itself comes alive through a somewhat archaic animation style, accompanied by classic sound effects. with a violently visceral second act attack of tokyo that will have you on the edge of your seat. regrettably, the entire final act felt deflated. the excitement of the atomic rays ultimately left nothing else enthralling, with the political debates wearing thin. the lack of character attachment exhumed a slight clinical aesthetic that prevented an emotional investment towards the story and its white-collared individuals. fear not however, as godzilla is back and more formidable than ever."", ""how original, yet formulaic yet groundbreaking film this was. i really love how it embraced the campiness of godzilla yet made it work so well with the story. it's a story of godzilla finding his place in his own existence while the humans scramble around finding their existence from him. deep message with underlying smart script and fast paced dialogue with cinematography that carries this film all the way through. it's as if they actually sat and thought this one through. definitely a film to be looked back at for me.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg5ODA1NzQtZmNmNy00MmFhLTk1YjUtYTM2NDNmNjY4ODA1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Japan is plunged into chaos upon the appearance of a giant monster.

mia, as always, brings the best out of this kind of character a brave, headstrong and perky young lady holding her own destiny in her hand with an unbeatable belief in the impossible and depp actually did not disappoint me at all with his come-back as mad hatter his performance is way more amazing than in the first one. the story of his character in alice through the looking glass is so tailored to embrace his acting talent!

and who came out of nowhere. this makes me sad because it was getting more mature. but i understand it is a kids movie, so it's still entertaining and pleasant to watch, and i'm pretty sure the kids love this movie."", ""the third film in dreamworks enduring martial-arts-comedy franchise has managed the near impossibility of being simultaneously too predictable and too nonsensical. as a fan of the first two films, i often found myself defending them against detractors who claimed they were too prone to the narrative downfall of the deus-ex-machina an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation. with panda 3, that fight has become too much to wage. with story beats that are beyond lazy, we've abandoned the majestic fighting of the first 2, leaving us with nothing but childish humor and tons of unearned yet expected emotions. the story finds po played by the ever-perfect-for-the-role black trying to best a particularly tough new baddie, all the while discovering that his birth-dad is still alive and residing within a hidden community full of pandas. the new villain has a completely inexplicable backstory, but is mostly cool enough to make up for it, and the village of bears is plenty cute and funny. it even provides a respectable example of non-traditional parenting for modern times. unfortunately, it's all surrounded by the tired be yourself morality that kid's films can't seem to get away from. sure, the animation is as beautiful as ever, the score is cool, and there are a handful of genuine belly laughs. unfortunately, the overpowering sense of laziness in the script drags down this otherwise successful family outing, a product of trying to squeeze too many stories from one small beginning. kung fu panda 3 is missing the unique spirit of comedic fun and adventure that bolstered the previous two films to the top of the dreamworks animation stable."", 'the movie starts out good. it has a nice build up at first but this build up never leads to a climax. in each movie, po has mastered or at least realized and actualized an aspect of kung fu. the aspect chosen for this movie had no build up. po throughout the movie learns an integral skill of kung fu and the whole process is beautifully depicted but in the end the climax is rather sudden and a little too-good-to-be-true. the movie has a great villain which just keeps on improving with each movie. the character of the villain is explored in depth but i felt similar justice was not done to the furious five, shifu or po. the movie seemed a little rushed in the end which could have been converted into a whole other movie.', 'compared to the other kung fu panda movies, this one was a bit of a strange experience, at first i wasnt able to figure out why but now i think i can say why. there are 2 reasons as to why this movie fell flat, number one is the inclusion of chi in this movie, its a magical thing that plays a heavy influence on the movies plot, im not going to get into the exact details of what it is go watch the movie if you want to know how it works but the problem is that its magic, in a kung fu panda movie. now the previous 2 movies did have some magic in them, but it was never nearly this heavily plot relevant by any means, the last 2 movies were mostly about learning self discipline and control, not controlling magical forces to defeat a spirit warrior. at best, the magic in the past 2 movies was just the icing on the cake, here though this the main focus, which made me feel like i was watching some fanfiction written by an 8 year old. now for the second problem with the movie the villain kai, or more specifically, his abilities. the movie is very inconsistent with kais abilities, he seems to have the ability to instantly turn people into his own jade zombies if he can just get within 5 feet of them, but for some reason he only does it when the plot needs him to, all the other times he just fights everyone for seemingly no reason until the writers decide thats enough and he turns them into jade zombies. the movie never explains how exactly his powers work and it seems like the writers did that on purpose to make things easier for them. also the movie had a few major conveniences throughout it, which was annoying. im not gonna spoil it here but youll definetely notice it, especially the one during the final battle. overall it it just fell flat in my opinion, give this one a watch if you want but dont expect it to be as good as any of the previous ones', 'it is part 3 of an animated film that should be enough to tell you the level of quality you shall see. it has the cash in quality of any animated part 3 or direct-to-dvd product out there. there is no story or pacing. the voice cast of the originals show up for two or three lines and then vanish simply to obey their contracts. it is one of the most overly used story lines in the genre and one just simply has to roll with the punches hoping your children laugh. it is a cash in and you are watching it for your children or something in that regard. any other reason other than that leaves to me ask then why are you watching this?', 'not quite as good as kung fu panda 2 since it does rehash some plot elements from kung fu panda 2, but kung fu panda 3 is still a solid entry in this kung fu fighting

character development is thrown out the window, with bay thinking out loud do you know what kids love to see? explosions. mind-numbing action. see, look at my 'transformers' franchise. everybody loves it!. i will say that this is neither better or worse than its predecessor. take that as you will. after saving new york city, the turtles remain in the sewers taking no credit for their heroic deeds. shredder escapes and meets an inter-dimensional warlord, resulting in the turtles having to save the day without anyone knowing...again. so, improvements. the action was much grander, with the inclusion of various set pieces, and is filmed decently by green. the editing was proficient although occasionally succumbs to excessive quick cuts, especially during hand-to-hand combat with bebop and rocksteady who are welcome additions. the cartoonish antics seemingly felt right, particularly from the turtles. green settles on a mindless tone which makes for several humorous moments that younger audiences will appreciate. fox wasn't the worst actor either never said that before.... no, that title is awarded to amell who was insufferably irritating. i'm gonna be a detective!. yeah ok, tell us all of your future plans and life stories within the first minute of screen time. go ahead! perry was channelling his inner pantomime. linney's talents were wasted why laura, why!?. and karai as a character was utterly non-existent. this all stems down to the screenplay, and it was hideous. no wit. no sincere dialogue. just plain stupidity. there was a moment when the turtles discuss the feeling of acceptance and how they wish to be human. an investing perspective that attempts to endeavour into segregation, but that's quickly diminished by michelangelo's excessive foolish behaviour. many eye rolling moments were had. krang was underdeveloped and shredder lost all his menace. story-wise an absolute mess, but much better technically."", ""so i just saw the second instalment of tmnt and thought i'd give you a bit of how i felt after the movie. it was very much a michael bay movie. and before anyone jumps at me to say david green directed it not bay, i know, but he's an executive producer on it and it has bay written all over it. he's known to recycle his movie styles effects and i swear it has the exact same score as in the transformers!? anyway, i thought it was a fun movie, much like the first one. me and my friend both left the cinema saying pretty much the same thing. a fun movie, but a pretty forgettable fun movie. i don't know what bay's interest in megan fox is, but for some reason he keeps using her and she is pretty bad in this, though more tolerable than in the first movie. imo nothing more than eye candy for the viewers, which is visible from one of the very first scenes of her in a school girl outfit. the story line was very avengers like, we've seen it a million times already, so like i said before, fun to watch, but almost instantly forgettable. bebop and rocksteady looked cool, though i would've maybe liked a bigger fight between them and the turtles. krang looked awesome and even sounded cool, it's typical krang really, so was happy with that. stephen amell as casey jones i guess did the best he could with what he was given, though i couldn't help thinking he was going to pull out his bow and arrow every time he was on. at one point he says my only goal is to and i almost blurt out 'to save this city'!! ok, so now to what i enjoyed the most about the movie, the turtles themselves. i enjoyed all of their portrayals. they all did a very good job in bringing out their personalities in this movie. from michelangelo's humour to raphael's bad- assery to donatello's smarts and leonardo's command. they were very identifiable characters and i like seeing their chemistry on screen. overall i give the movie a 6.5 for keeping me entertained, yet i think it's one for the kids more so than the adults."", ""this movie is good for children visual effects, good music, funny dialogues, and get some characters from the main story about tmnt, but in my personal opinion, i enjoyed more the first saga 90's. good points about this movie are the defined roles about turtles raphael, michelangelo, leonardo, and donatello. it includes new characters, and do emphasis in cinematic characteristics about new york liberty's statue, parade, pizza, police,  basketball. megan fox like april is a good election, too. the message that i recovered on this movie is workteam. if you are looking for a good movie to see with children it's a good election."", ""when a new tmnt tv series comes out, some get excited, some don't because they think their childhood is ruined, it has always been like that, throughout every single iteration, every single cartoon and of course, the movies. when the tmnt reboot hit theaters 2 years ago, a lot of the people didn't like it, whether it was the direction, the cgi turtles, the plot lines etc, but of course kids loved it, it was a box office success and here we are, in a sequel, and man i am happy that the first was a success. tmnt out of the shadows is many steps towards the right direction, it is gi joe retaliation compared to rise of cobra, the empire strikes back of the turtles, the dark knight of the franchise and the winter soldier to the first captain america movie, it is one of these movies that are so much better then the original, not that the original was great to begin with. the tmnt lore has so many stories, so many goofy over the top characters, combine with it heart and brotherhood relation and you got a timeless franchise that will always work. this movie unlike its predecessor which was afraid on going full ninja turtles, actually does, it goes to the extreme actually, it is not afraid of showing a giant rhino and a giant warthog, it is not afraid of showing an over the top mad scientist, an alien talking brain or evil actual ninjas kicking the hell out of people, in fact it celebrates it which means if you grew up in the 80s and you are a fan of either the 80s show or the new nickelodeon one, you are going to absolutely love this, if not then go fk yourself, it is a love letter from the creators, or maybe it is a scheme to play with our nostalgia, but who cares? the first movie was more like megan fox and the turtles, this one starts with the turtles, and ends with the turtles, they are the heart and soul of the movie, april o'neil, vern, casey jones and all other humans are side characters these turtles are the best turtle incarnations ever on the big screen, even beating the 1990 movie, the turtles are spot on, they look real, they have a soul, they are bad ass, the characters are spot on and every thing about them is just perfect, they face struggles and it is actually believable in this one unlike the first, the new bebop and rocksteady are also spot on, their bro-manse relation ship is absolutely fun to watch, they are there to have fun and they feel like they jumped from the old cartoon, their cgi is also well done and again, they just feel perfect, i'm not talking about the other last act of the movie character because it might be a spoiler, but i liked him and even if the final act seems like its done so many times before, it is still fun because you got the turtles. shredder is there but this is not his movie at all and he is more like a secondary character. and now for the bad if you are not a fan of the turtles, or you are more like the dark, edgy turtles fan then this is not for you, this is a silly, over the top movie that feels more like saturday morning show on the big screen, kids will love it and their nostalgic parents will love it as well, it requires for you to know and recognize these characters because other wise you will repeat this sentence with yourself throughout the entire movie what the actual fk is going on? this time this movie chose a side, they chose their audience, you know what you are getting from now on and i'm happy about that. and i must say that i definitely look forward to watching more sequels and i hope that this is a hit. this movie is impossible to rate, because if you are a fan then this is planetary alignment for you, if not then stay away, i gave this a seven because i know that is not for everybody, and i can only say that i liked the movie a lot..... cawabonga."", ""i along with many others had a lot of problems with the 2014 tmnt movie produced by michael bay. i didn't hate the movie as much as the general public seemed to, but the movie is definitely flawed. most of my problems had to do with the movie taking itself way too seriously at times and the overabundance of human characters... which brings us to teenage mutant ninja turtles out of the shadows. the sequel takes place a year after the defeat of the shredder and new york city and the turtles seem to be at peace. that is until a scientist by the name of baxter stockmanplayed by tyler perry breaks shreddernow played by brian tee out of prison for a sinister plot to take over the world with the help of krang, and inter dimensional alien and his technodrome. stockman and shredder also recruit two criminals by the names of bebop and rocksteadyplayed by gary anthony williams and wwe superstar sheamus to ensure their plan, and it's up to the turtles along with april o'neilmegan fox vern fenwickwill arnett and their new friend casey jonesstephen amell to stop them. i saw the movie and was absolutely dumbfounded at how much i enjoyed it. first off, the performances of all four turtles all have their own distinct personality and are featured way more than they were in the first movie. which makes it way more powerful when the turtles go through emotional turmoil. most of the other performances are great as well, i loved every villain in this movie, especially bebop and rocksteady. their characters were so fun and energetic and faithful to the original 80s cartoon and they are a joy to watch on screen as well as krang and shredder. another great thing about this movie are the action scenes. there is one scene in particular that takes place on an airplane which was one of the best action scenes i've seen all year, and the final fight is also very entertaining. the humor in this movie is very similar to the cartoons and there are many, many references to the other turtles universes. although the movie is not perfect. while the movie focuses on the turtles, the scenes involving the main human protagonists are not very good at all, especially will arnett's scenes. another problem that plagues this movie is the amount of sub plots. you have the main plot line, as well as the introductions of beboprocksteady, krang and baxter stockman and casey jones, leo facing leadership troubles, all the human crap, the brothers fighting among each other and the movie isn't subtitled out of the shadows for no reason. it feels like at least one of those sub plots could've been completely cut from the movie. i get that the makers of the film wanted to include fan service to make up for the first movie, but that should never come as a price for good film making. in the end, teenage mutant ninja turtles out of the shadows is a very good film with good performances and great action, but suffers from batman v superman syndrome of having too many plots for it's own good. however, if you are a ninja turtles fan, you should check this one out, even if it's not the best turtles film.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgyNWExMzUtOTAyMy00ZjkzLWFhNzgtZTFhOTBmN2RhZGJhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"The Turtles get into another battle with their enemy the Shredder, who has acquired new allies: the mutant thugs Bebop and Rocksteady and the alien being Krang."
Robert Schwentke,Naomi Watts,Theo James,Zoë Kravitz,Action Adventure Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller,allegiant,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3410834/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1,"['allegiant was rather disappointing considering i really enjoyed the first 2 movies. this one was very lackluster on the action and tris character was much less involved in the plot. i hate the fact that this movie ended on a cliffhanger though. because it has been 4 years ago and due to the bad box office this film got, there has been no real try to make a fourth and final film.', ""i enjoyed the hell out of this film. it had me constantly engaged and interested in the story. i like the conflict between the characters, but glad they didn't make it dramatic. my biggest problem is there are such big ideas in this movie, they needed more time to develop some of them. a few scenes here to flesh out the conflict more. i am pretty sure they didn't do it because they have to follow the currently trend right now, mindless action set pieces with very little story. i appreciate the writers and director trying to accomplish something bigger, but there were still some missing parts. i still enjoyed the movie a lot and appreciate the effort."", ""so... without spoiling the book or this movie the movie sucked, the book did not. there is way, way more sci-fi then necessary, and bad sci-fi that is! it's really poorly done, bad cgi and stuff. and where the story from the books was at times confusing, this was downright dumb and mad no sense. the biggest book-moments were cut out, probably to make room for the bad cgi... i kind of expected it to be bad, 'cause the 2nd one wasn't that good either. it also seems the actors get less and less convincing with each movie. contrary to the hunger games that also differed from the books somewhat, but functional imho, these don't live up to the books at all. if you read them, don't watch the movies. if you've watched the movies but started liking them less and less, read the books instead! they're worth it!"", ""upon seeing allegiant, i had mixed feelings about it. at first upon seeing the reviews i was a little in shocked at how much criticism it was receiving, but sometimes your opinion can be different from the critics who review the movie. so i saw the movie, and as i watched the movie i started remembering scenes from the book, since i haven't read the book in a while. there was scenes that surprise me, which i thoroughly enjoyed because i love surprises. and although, yes the movie strays away from the source material, we as people should be more open-minded about book to film adaptations. as a fan of the books it can be nerve wrecking to have a good book turned into an awful movie, but i like to think about how much time was put into making a film. an actoractress works hard to follow the script that is given to them, the director has a vision in mind for the film, which is hard work in itself. and putting the film together takes a lot of shots to achieve in the amount of time they are given. this is why we have deleted scenes to begin with. i praise this cast for not giving up on this project and continue to do their best to pull off a movie adaptation of a best- selling series.all in all, i enjoyed this movie and recommend it to people who love stories and fans who can still appreciate a movie despite its obvious changes."", ""the divergent series allegiant is the latest divergent movies that comes out at march 10 in england and march 18 in usa starring shailene woodley, theo james, jeff daniels, miles teller, ansel elgort, maggie q, with octavia spencer, and naomi watts. once again, shailene woddley is bringing the best performance through the whole movie, we get to see more of tobias in this one instead of just woodley's character, tris. the visual effects were amazing, the cinematography was incredible and of course, the acting was fantastic, especially woodley. it's a lot more action packed than insurgent and divergent, there's a lot of running, the wall sequences that we see in the trailer was the best action scene in the movie. four and tris chemistry is better in this one. though the last 30 minutes of this movie is more like ok people, let's wrap it up. but you will be impressed through the whole movie by woodley's work. she's definitely a big  for this movie. the only issued i have was the pacing and plot. it was kinda messy but very well put together. 7.810"", 'i read all of the books because of how curious i was to see if the movies matched up. what i really enjoy in an adaptation movie is how it brings a story to life allegiant takes the story which was quite interesting, and throws the story line in pieces. the suspense and anticipation that i experienced with the previous two films and stories is not the same as with allegiant. besides the story line taking a tangent from its original story, the revised story line is bland and predictable. i do not have high expectations for the sequel if they continue to deviate from the original story so drastically. i really hope that i will be proved wrong, but i am thoroughly disappointed.', ""allegiant was such a good movie, it wasn't exactly like the book, but i really like the creative changes they made. first off,allegiant is a combination of action, adventure, romance, and fantasy. i really liked that they didn't take the romance too far in this film. secondly, i liked that the movie explains everything that you might have missed or been questioning after the first two movies. thirdly, the acting was phenomenal, the cast for this movie did a really good job playing with the audience's emotions. lastly allegiant did a really good job making the movie fit the age group of people who loved the book, when you make a movie like this it is really hard to keep it kid friendly when even the book is a little questionable, and i think they did a really good job making the film fit the pg13 criteria."", ""i just saw tonight the 3rd part of divergent. and i was bluffed by the scenario, the acting of the characters essentially. last year, i saw the 2nd part without knowing the plot. and i just caught up this week by viewing the 1st part and re-watching insurgent to have a fresh feeling. and i don't regret it. allegiant is more cerebral, there's less action i think. the political and philosophical aspects of the story are better explained here. i liked to see the characters play their part independently, to see them struggle with their own issues. even if their problems are intertwined with the others. they are a perfect team of saviors. jeff daniels as david is excellent. we can see that tris and tobias have matured a lot. they still form a great pair. the visual and fx effects were amazing. and finally, just as a joke, it was pleasant to not listen the name jeanine pronounced so often my name is jeanine.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzZlYzZlNDktMDAxMS00OGZiLThkYzAtNWEzNDliYjAyZmM5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"After the earth-shattering revelations of Insurgent, Tris must escape with

Timur Bekmambetov,Morgan Freeman,Ayelet Zurer,Moises Arias,Adventure Drama History,ben-hur,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2638144/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1,"[""admittedly, re-telling the story of ben-hur in modern cinema seems remarkably unnecessary since the original film was already so good in it's own merit. but to say that this is a bad movie would be a lie. there are plenty of powerful moments that portray betrayal and survival with its dialogue staying engaging and competent. convincing acting from jack huston and toby kebbell helps establish a heartfelt brotherhood of joy and sadness that shines in key moments in all three acts. even the supporting cast does a solid job establishing the tention of the conflict at hand. a serviceable soundtrack and action set pieces build to a good climax as well. i do agree with most that timur bekmambetov's frequent free style camera control is distracting with the consistent shaking and close-up shots rob what could have been sweeping epic shots to fuel the emotions of the film better. and the way some dialogue is delivered falls flat when the passage of time or awkward pacing steals their thunder. and of course, it's worth confirming that the cgi scenes are...pretty bad at times. in the end, why fix what isn't broken? it's tough to live up to an already fantastic film, and this 2016 adaptation of ben-hur will likely drown in history as another hollywood cash-grab. but if the story of ben-hur resonates within your soul, this adaptation is worth at least a single view."", ""what a dreadful effort, it took a lot of creativity for this film to be this bad. the frustrating thing they didn't even have to take a chance, the book is over a 150 years old, there was a blockbuster stage show and 2 blockbuster films, all they had to do was minorly tweak the original book, or use one of the smash-hit films as a guide. i venture to say ben hur is one of our great stories, it has everything, love, spectacle, honour, adventure, redemption, meaning, a moral, and even a miracle' where could you go wrong. but wrong they went and i was never so angry and disappointed at a film and it was all down to ineptitude and pure genius at incompetence i mean how could anyone spend 100 million on ben hur and get it so wrong, the mind boggles. i give it 4 stars as the 2 great iconic scenes of which we all know, the naval battle and the chariot race were quite good. but the story around those events, the iconic ben hur story was complete and utter motiveless drivel."", ""i liked it. it wasnt great but it was for sure good. there was action throughout the movie and i didnt get bored even thought it's a looong movie. if you compare it to the original it's not something ground-breaking. but if you put the comparison aside, you will like it. its a good story and the acting for the most part is good. its an ok remake and definitely not as bad as make it seem to be"", ""remakes, reboots, re-imaginings, revamps  whatever you may call them, they're predominantly regarded as unoriginal andor unnecessary cash-ins. they're not all a waste of time think the departed or let me in, but it's vapid movies like this that ensure their bad name stays in tact. lets start with the positives though. with russian director timur bekmambetov day watch, wanted behind the camera stylish action sequences are all but guaranteed, and an incredible battle at sea witnessed from below the decks undeniably delivers on this front. he's also lucky his two leading men, jack huston as the eponymous persecuted jew and toby kebbell as his vengeful roman adopted brother, are both extremely strong actors who manage to turn even the worst dialogue into semi-watchable melodrama. that's where the praise stops unfortunately, for the rest of the film shouts disaster. the most notable flaw is the casting of morgan paycheque freeman, who plummets to new depths of awfulness thanks to his phoned-in performance, a lazy and clichéd narration, and a wig that'll enter the hairpiece hall of shame alongside travolta's hairdo from battlefield earth. there are also a plethora of bizarre choices made by the filmmakers, including an embarrassingly out-of-place epilogue featuring jesus rodrigo santoro that should've been either fleshed out more throughout the runtime or cut away entirely. as is increasingly common in modern blockbusters there's also a heavy use of cgi  which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing  except here it is woefully underdone and sticks out like a sore thumb, especially in the numerous wide shots attempting to establish scale and grandeur. perhaps most disappointing is the underwhelming chariot-race finale that, for all its hand-held camera-work and gritty intentions, is stunted by messy editing, weirdly absent violence and poor choreography that fails to hide the dumb conveniences within the race. capped off with an atrocious song played over the final moments, ben-hur 2.0 is a bland and misjudged rehash of a swords-and-sandals classic.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ2NzYxMDQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk2MzczOTE@._V1_.jpg,"Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince falsely accused of treason by his adopted brother, an officer in the Roman army, returns to his homeland after years at sea to seek revenge, but finds redemption."

with such heroism and an underlying story of love, the finest hour was really enjoyable to watch. actor chris pine did a wonderful job as the lead, bernie webber, capturing the action and emotion behind his courageous voyage. it is really thrilling and scary to see people like those in the coast guard that put their lives on the line to save others. it's so commendable and director, craig gillespie did a fantastic job of capturing that. the cast overall did a wonderful job portraying their real life characters. the cinematography was incredible as well. filming such a large at-sea feature is not an easy task and it was done very well."", ""the finest hours tells the harrowing and courageous true story of the most daring rescue mission that the u.s. coast guard has, to this day, ever had to accomplish. starring chris pine, casey affleck, ben foster and josh stewart, the film's cast is stacked to the brim with talent but the director, craig guillesspe takes away from their efforts by telling the story in the sappiest of ways. the film starts with bernie webber chris pine on a blind date with his friend as he looks forward to meeting miriam holliday grainger, the woman he has been talking on the phone with for months on end. it is a sappy way to start the film but that sappiness is soon discarded as soon as we are introduced to the uss pendelton and its crew. the crew, headed by casey affleck's brilliant and film carrying performance as ray sybert, is in the midst of a terrible winter storm and they struggle to maintain control of the ship. after being battered by the brutal waves off of nantucket, the ship is split in two and must stay afloat until help arrives. the film takes its shape during the scenes with the pendleton and it's crew. casey affleck gives a good performance that remains as one of the most interesting of the film coupled with some truly gasp-worthy scenes of suspense and action. this is one thing the film has going for it, it has some truly breath taking action sequences that will leave you clawing at your arm rest and holding your breath. while an abundance of cgi is used, it still feels the way its supposed to. cold and brutal. while the film is no match for the conditions shown in the revenant, it still will make you shiver once or twice just looking at the weather these brave souls have to go up against. while these sequences and qualities make the finest hours a thoroughly watchable and enjoyable film, unfortunately the film compromises, what could be, white knuckle action and substitute it with a half-assed love story between bernie and miriam that borders on annoying after the first hour and equally annoying and poorly done boston accents. the accents show pine and grainger as the biggest culprits. grainger's performance as miriam is annoying and wildly unrealistic and pine is spineless in his rendition of, what many consider, one of the bravest men that ever served in the coast guard. grainger's miriam serves as more of a nuisance than a help to the film, which is rather disappointing because the role screams for a more able actress to take on the role and another screenwriter to make her character more than just a poorly written female character. it really throws the film for a loop, making it as lopsided as you can get. despite this, the film moves through its main storyline with tenacity that is hard to match. one sequence in particular features the rescue crew trying to pass over the nantucket ocean bar, a point in the ocean that features out going and incoming waves crashing against one another. the sequence is harrowing, the pacing of it is brilliant and the sheer intensity is one that the film can't seem to match for the remainder of the film. the film, while it does get your heart pounding, lacks character drama and depth. while we care about the characters, we only care about the actors playing them. if lesser known actors were in these roles, it would be clearer that the film could have used another rewrite and a stronger female character. overall, the finest hours is a decent rescue film that serves its purpose of entertaining you but it does little else in the way of separating it from every other film of its type.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTY1MDU1NzYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTA0MDQyNzE@._V1_.jpg,The Coast Guard makes a daring rescue attempt off the coast of Cape Cod after a pair of oil tankers are destroyed during a blizzard in 1952.

krasinski has just been reassigned as a guard for the us diplomatic compound in benghazi, libya. what starts off as a routine assignment changes on september 11, 2012. when a group of insurgents breach the embassy and attempt to kill the us ambassador, jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision. follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help their fellow soldiers. i was looking forward to watching this, but i was also a little worried at the same time. the story is interesting and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it was directed by michael bay. for that reason i was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. i'm not ashamed to admit that i was wrong. this is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. the movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. i liked it more than i expected to. overall, not just a surprisingly good michael bay movie, a good movie period. i give this a high b."", ""this movie hit home. every pmc who signs every contract knows they have no us military support. a pmc or grouping of pmc's is on their own. only a president can order us military action on a foreign nation without the senate and house approval. had president obama sent in a military for for support or even ordered air support for those pmc's would have made a single handed de-facto declaration of war against libya, which at the time out armed forces were engaged in military operations in afghanistan and iraq. adding a third conflict with another arab state would have over extended us armed forces resources to one region, complicating a difficult situation already happening. i am glad most of those pmc's made it home alive to their families and did exactly what their contract states, solved the situation by themselves. great movie ,but brought up horrible memories for me. with the facts i presented keep those facts in mind when sitting down to watch this movie or watch it again.  once was enough for me.  great directing and acting, pretty close to factual. watch it or rewatch it with the facts i presented in mind and the movie will make a whole lot more sense to the viewer."", 'i found this movie to be very intense and riveting. the audience seemed to have a need to make an unusual number of trips to the snack bar and rest room and i found myself becoming frustrated by the number of interruptions. the movie is not for the faint of heart, as there are a number of scenes with graphic depiction of injuries. regardless of your political affiliation, if you have any thoughts about what happened at benghazi, you need to see this movie. michael bay does a great job of portraying what happened. additionally, with the exception of one individual who s portrayed as not wanting to take action, he does not take the obvious opportunity to lay blame at any single individual in the us government. he clearly portrays a small group of men as heroes. without their courage and willingness to fight against what appears to be an overwhelming force many more lives would have been lost. i do not often see movies twice, but this movie is likely to be an exception... in closing, if michael bay is 90 accurate in his depiction of what happened, our government the us government, owes a huge debt of gratitude and an apology for their lack of action to 6 very brave men.', ""i'm giving it an 8 out of 10 . only reason it doesn't get a ten is there's no after scenes showing all the traitors and gutless politicians that left them out to dry being prosecuted and sentenced to death for treason. nothing about the lies and doublespeak to the american people and the complicity of the lame stream media and how fast they got behind whatever bullsht the white house decided to say. the acting and effects were top notch and realistic. the amount of corruption and people involved in it in the end was astounding. there needs to be more documentary  movies about these incidents and actual trials."", ""13 hours is an incredibly intense war movie that's thrilling, tense and emotional whilst easily being one of michael bay's best films. james badge dale and john krasinski both give incredible performances and pablo schreiber, max martini, david denman and dominic fumusa are all great and together they have fantastic chemistry. michael bay's direction is excellent and more restrained in places than usual. it's extremely well filmed with visceral action sequences and it's also extremely well paced. the music by lorne balfe is amazing."", ""don't be dissuaded by the fact that this is a michael bay film the usually bombastic blockbuster director shows a relative level of restraint and integrity in his execution of this intense modern war tale. sure, there are explosions, slow motion shots and chest-thumping moments of heroism, but unlike his increasingly egregious directorial flourishes in the transformers series, here they are comparatively controlled and organic. bay's propensity for overlong runtimes results in a repetitiveness that dampens the third act's power, however he executes the gun battles with enough ferocity and immediacy to maintain the immersion. chuck hogan's screenplay  adapted from mitchell zuckoff's novel  doesn't bring anything new to the genre, yet he adeptly avoids clichés through grounded characters and authentic interactions. a little less finger pointing would've been great though. akin to peter berg's lone survivor, this libyan-set true story relies heavily on the core group's chemistry and relatability to elevate the simple premise into a more affecting and interesting combat picture. james badge dale and john krasinski lead the pack as long-time mates who miss their families but love their job, both bringing emotional heft and sincerity to roles which also required bulked-up physical transformations. the other notable cast member is pablo schreiber of orange is the new black fame, who imbues his team joker with a surprising amount of depth and gravitas whilst also delivering most of the movie's levity. it's not in the same league as the great motion pictures depicting war, nevertheless 13 hours is a kinetic, adrenaline-pumping and compelling yarn that offers a solid cinematic viewing experience."", 'it is honestly hard to believe that the guy behind all that transformers crap made a solid, almost flawless war movie with an amazing cast. i have no idea why this is rated so low, acting is on point, pacing is great and the build-up keeps you engaged even on the second viewing.', 'talk about action packed! 13 hours had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! this film tells the story based on true unimaginable, events that occurred in benghazi in 2012. john krasinski and james badge dale did an amazing job transforming into their roles as jack da silva and rone woods. it really is incredibly the courage military men show during times of chaos and struggle. it is so commendable and it is great that stories like this are shown on the big screen so the general public can appreciate the true sacrifice these men and women give to protect our country. michael bay, per usual, did not disappoint with his awesome special effects and extreme stunts. a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by

"", ""i absolutely love the first conjuring movie. when i watch that movie, it gets under my skin. i actually feel troubled and somewhat terrible after watching it. i rank the first movie rather high. it bothers me almost as much as the exorcist does. i don't even like to watch it at night. the feeling of dread in that movie is heavy. in the sequel, my patience was challenged a bit. it plays out like a sampler of far better films such as poltergeist and the evil dead. it's fun for what it is a popcorn movie. if you enjoy fun ghost movies, see this one. if you're expecting a movie on the level of the first conjuring, you may find yourself a bit disappointed."", ""the conjuring 2 is directed by james wan and stars vera farmiga and patrick wilson. the conjuring 2 is an excellent horror movie and just a flat out great movie in general. from the camera-work to the performances this movie delivers on all fronts. the plot follows a family in poverty in einfield,england that start experiencing strange happenings in their home. after things become much worse over a period of time the warrens are contacted to come and help. this is a very scary movie thanks to james wan's direction from lingering and tracking shots he is truly a master behind the camera. the scares come quite often as scenes will linger and bring a huge sense of tension and get you when your not expecting it bringing some very frightening scenes. vera farmiga and patrick wilsons performances are excellent as you buy into their relationship and learn some lessons on marriage. the children actors have the be given credit too as they are great in this film. these kids are terrified of the haunting and you will feel their dread. i am so satisfied with this film generally people worry about horror sequels usually because they can turn out unsuccessful, but i am happy to report as a big fan of the first movie this is just as great.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRkMDlmZWEtMzQyYy00YzgyLTgwM2QtNzgxYmIwNGVlYmJlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to North London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a supernatural spirit.

'ride along 2' does nothing to improve upon the original. as a matter of fact, it is somehow worse than the original. the action, comedy, and elements of the plot are shamelessly copied from the original. the film moves location from atlanta to miami. why miami? because miami is a huge tourist spot that attracts tons of people. atlanta does not. so of course the film jumps location. instead of being creative, putting a unique spin on things, or making a memorable movie, ride along 2 opts to make a cheap buck. most people will forget about this movie within a week."", ""ice cube and kevin hart lacked chemistry in buddy-cop film ride along. ice cube's 'take no prisoners' approach to hart's serious opposite one actually pays off this time round. they're huge fun in comparison. ride along 2 is a significant step upward, but still doesn't pass what mark kermode calls the 'six laugh test. i laughed twice. the same joke gets rinsed and repeated ben hart wants james' cube affection and acceptance, whilst james belittles ben round every corner. it's nearing ben's wedding day, and the 'brothers-in-law' are off catching drug smugglers in miami. a dialled- down ken jeong and strict cop olivia munn save this film from drowning, and give it the boost it very much needed.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODAzMzcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMDI1NjE@._V1_.jpg,"As his wedding day approaches, Ben heads to Miami with his soon-to-be brother-in-law James to bring down a drug dealer who's supplying the dealers of Atlanta with product."

and not remembering much of them. leslie mann is the older sister to johnson, an independent woman with a younger love- interest rattling her cage. and then there's the weird alison brie, the

saddest, and truest performance to date. yes im still talking about a raunchy comedy here. there is more to this movie than you might think. the men in the film are actually better written that most

went in expecting garbage, no lies. that's what most new comedies have been lately, just sad attempts at not-funny sexual jokes with little-to-no plot. this movie in particular is based off a book, so maybe that's why it did so much better. the movie had a weak plot, but it was interesting nonetheless. all the characters and situations were believable. the movie looked at issues that are common to both men and women in their 20s and 30s, and explored the pros and cons of these issues, and turned it into something funny. the only unbelievable part was that a beligerent, careless chick robin could land a job at a prestigious law firm. i enjoyed the movie."", ""i went and watched this movie how to be single with two of my other single friends. we went expecting it to be a hilarious movie and that's exactly what it was. its basically a show of how each person reacts with breakups relationships in their own ways. we laughed the whole time. i kind of expected it to answer the question a little bit more but it didn't at all. just kind of showed how they coped with the relationship. most of the humor was kind of awkward in that matter. it kind of switched back and forth between being single sucks and needing to be in an relationship than back to its okay to be single. for the most part we enjoyed it because of the characters who were in it but i have seen better."", ""this is a better than average romantic comedy. i gave this one an extra star, because, although it largely followed the rom-com formula, meaning happy endings for most of the characters, it wasn't obvious who

can actually enjoy trashy films that are so terrible that they are awesome, but this one actually tries to make a point and it fails miserably. the writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, even

understand why people hate this movie i thought it was hilarious and recommend watching it"", ""i'm serious, literally no one in the theater laughed. there were a very few chuckles but not a single laugh. the movie was like torture because they kept using the same joke over and over and over again. a joke that wasn't funny the first time it was used was delivered multiple times. the first neighbors movie was funny, not the funniest movie made or anything like that but pretty funny. this movie is beyond lame. remember when i told you they kept using the same jokes over and over again? there was literally a 10 minute timeframe in which the movie used the same joke about 5 times. around that time i looked at my watch and saw that i was only 20 minutes into the stupid movie! basically, the problem with this movie is that it isn't funny and kept reusing the same jokes. they even use jokes from the original movie multiple times. it was just plain sad. another thing, i think seth rogen has become the new adam sandler. he keeps playing the same character in very single movie, and he has finally and completely wore out his welcome. this will be the final time i pay money to see a seth rogen movie. another thing i learned is that chloë grace moretz is officially an awful actress. everyone loved her as hit-girl and ever since kickass she has gotten a free pass from everyone including myself but in this movie we get to see a ton of her acting and it is like watching rejected scenes from a twilight movie. you get sick of her after about 40 minutes. man, i know everyone involved in this movie did it for a paycheck but i think it is ultimately going to hurt more than a few careers. i warn you, save your money and do not pay a penny to watch this movie. it sucks. you've been warned."", ""this is one of the few if any films where the sequel is actually better than the original. in saying this i didn't actually like the original, so it really wasn't much

anyway. it's a good relax and be entertained, without having to think too much kind of film. this time around, hence the title, instead of chauvinistic fraternity bros, there are feminist sorority

painfully to an unremarkable conclusion that can't get there soon enough. the actors did their part and there were maybe 3 or 4 amusing scenes. in between was a lot of painfully long spells that weren't funny and didn't serve to build a viable story line. i'm assuming that the teenage viewer was the target audience but my teens and their friends weren't entertained. the main plot was kind of a vague and anemic attempt at some type of hodgepodge of double standards for female college students fused with a generic anti-adult past usual college age rebelliousness. it all lacked the continuity of a plausible story by movie standards. not only does this movie require a willing suspension of disbelief, it requires a total suspension of expectation. it just sucked. that's as elegant a review as the content deserves."", ""neighbors 2 sorority rising is a comedy film directed by nicholas stoller and written by five different writers. it is the sequel to the surprisingly good and successful neighbors that came out in 2014. this one has old and new faces on the casting side, with returning names like seth rogen, zac efron and rose byrne, plus new cast members such as the amazingly talented chloë grace moretz on the sorority side, with her new sisters that are played by kiersey clemons and beanie feldstein. overall i quiet enjoyed this movie, and in my opinion it is even funnier and better than the first one. the overall casting choices are perfect, and while the old cast is still incredibly funny and likable, chloë grace moretz totally steals the show in my opinion. she's so darn likable and definitely delivers the perfect one-liners that are super funny. her character is also likable and interesting at the same time. zac efron is also a casting choice that really impressed me on the first neighbors, and while he was funny on that movie, in this one he just takes it to a whole new level. i pretty much have liked this guy in every movie he's been in so far in his career. he certainly has comedic talent and i hope he keeps on doing what he's doing. sure some of the jokes and story-lines of this movie feel like a deja- vu from the first movie, but i think that this is just a trend for comedy sequels now. repeating the same things from the first movie is something that many other comedy sequels have done recently, like ted 2 and 22 jump street. but it worked for both of them and it works for this one too. i really liked this movie, and while it is not comedic gold or a classic, it isn't trying to be either. it is a fun and enjoyable summer

the worst singer ever is unimaginative and also missleading. she was after all someone who took the probably enormous trouble to learn arias that would take great skill and technique to master. they are not easy to sing badly, or to even get through at all. consequently meryl streep's vocal performance here is amazing. but the film shows some lack of imagination as well how about the mystery of how aware jenkins really was of the quality of her singing, which could hardly be described on a simple axis from bad to good? also, wasn't jenkins herself active in creating her own little bubble of audience and her public persona? here, st clair bayfield is shown as single-handedly managing and protecting her, which creates a dynamic both troubling and simplistic."", ""inspired by the true story of a former stage performer who tried to make it as a singer in the 1940s despite having no actual talent, 'florence foster jenkins' is a far more layered motion picture than it might sound on paper. the film is actually more about florence's husband than florence herself, and convincing as meryl streep is in the title role, this is hugh grant's film all the way, delivering a fine turn as her devoted husband who smiles throughout all her terrible singing and works hard to keep the critics at bay to avoid her feelings being crushed. on an even more complex note, grant has a girlfriend who he lives with in a separate apartment paid by florence, and amidst the layers of his character are his conflicting feelings of gratitude toward florence and a desire to live his own life. grant is very funny too with excellent support from simon helberg as a nebbish accompanying pianist and there are several laugh-out-loud moments as his attempts to keep florence blissfully ignorant spiral out of control. delightful as the film may be, it is not without its drawbacks. in particular, the film never feels like it properly delves into florence's past by concentrating on her husband more than her and intriguing side elements like a fear of knives and a mysterious satchel are brought up without ever being properly resolved. christian mckay also feels wasted in a very small role. the virtues here though far outshine the vices and with creative costumes throughout and a catchy, upbeat alexandre desplat score, 'florence foster jenkins' is a pleasure to both watch and listen to, quite aside from the high quality acting and curious story."", ""there's something rather wonderful about people who manage to do things incredibly badly - william macgonagall, the world's worst poet, and eddie the eagle edwards, the world's worst ski-jumper, spring to mind but florence foster jenkins is in the pantheon as the world's worst singer. i have a cd of the few recordings she made, and not the least remarkable aspect of meryl streep's performance is that she superbly captures la jenkins' extraordinary singing voice. this, however, is only one part of a beautiful performance, in which streep gives us a touchingly vulnerable jenkins. i saw this film expecting to laugh - and indeed there are some great comic moments. what i didn't expect, however, was to find myself sympathising with the title character so much, to the extent that i found myself rooting for her - not to give a magnificent recital, but at least to believe that she had. hugh grant plays jenkins' sort-of husband they never actually married in real life, though the film implies that they did and manager. it's a fine performance, and he's lost none of his ease with comic scenes. he also has some heartwarmingly touching scenes in which he gives jenkins the platonic love she is so desperate for, and when he tries to shield her from the truth. even so, i was never quite sure how to reconcile this side of his character with the double-life he leads without jenkins' knowledge. simon helberg is excellent as jenkins' much put-upon accompanist, and nina arianda provides a good turn as a gold-digger who displays some unexpected heart. highly recommended."", ""elderly heiress in 1944, a patron of the arts who often claims that music is her life, decides to make her operatic singing debut after a month of study--either unaware she has a terrible singing voice, batty and deluded, or simply indifferent to the possibility she might be a flop. although florence foster jenkins is well-coiffed, handsomely-produced and well-heeled, it's about a quirky american woman in new york city, and it's not just the british and scottish locales substituting for america that help to dislocate it--the film has a very british sensibility, and is a bit too timid in taking us out of florence's immediate circle perhaps in fear of exposing the picture's origins. meryl streep plays the title role with her customary aplomb she isn't a reckless actress--florence herself was probably more apt to throw caution to the winds than is streep--but she's enjoying herself here and works well with hugh grant as her cheating-but-not-disloyal husband and simon helberg as her somewhat-embarrassed pianist. stephen frears directed, and he's lethargic at the start with exaggerated cutaways to an audience watching a production in the theater jenkins founded, silly reaction shots that could have easily been eliminated by a more nimble editor. however, the film picks up considerably in its second-half and proves to be an enjoyable piece of fluff. 12 from "", ""florence foster jenkins ended up being better than i imagined, i found a movie very entertaining, more is full of problems, but we will talk

yes, at the end of each mad money program, or really any financial program, there is always a disclaimer at the end of these shows telling the viewers to consult a professional financial accountant, or broker before making any rash decisions regarding your funds and investments and in a sense the shows in question tried to take no responsibility if someone ever was to lose a lot because of these programs and their hosts on the air. what if a situation like what happens in money monster, were to really happen? a blue collar worker invests every cent they have based on a stock that was highly recommended on said program only to have it go belly up and end up losing everything in the process. i think we can all understandably say we would be furious and looking for someone to blame after everything was gone. but who is to blame? is it the host of the television program who is trying to entice you with a lot of bells and whistles and fancy jargon over buying a stock? or perhaps the station and the people who put the program on the air? are they to blame? or does it go even deeper than that and in fact involves shady business dealings with the actual companies themselves, who may have more stake and more involved in a company's win, or loss than you might expect? are they the ones who should handle the blame and take on the responsibility of those who are out nearly everything buying, or selling one of their stocks? these questions and more is what the new film, money monster tries to answer in what is a very captivating, thrilling and entertaining 98 minutes of a movie. george clooney plays the obnoxious lee gates, who is the host of money monster and clooney as in typical fashion, is really good at playing suave, somewhat sophisticated and arrogant characters such as gates and here he is totally believable in the performance and does a great job. that is one of the film's really strong points which is the acting, whether it be from pros such as clooney, or julia roberts to newcomer jack o'connell, all deliver exceptional performances and really keep the film going. this type of a film needs three main things to keep it's momentum and audience interested and that is truly capable actors who can handle the material they are given, but also who fascinate us as viewers and want us to keep watching them and see where and what happens to their characters. also we need a script that has a plausible yet fascinating beginning, middle and final act with just the right amount of things to thrill the audience, keep us guessing and wanting to see what happens at the end and also a certain message to drive home to the viewers to leave some food for thought after you have left the theatre and to truly keep the film fresh in your mind. the direction also has to know how to keep the scenes in question lively and fast paced, but also allowing us in it's brief running time to have a certain connectedness to it's protagonists and make us believe in what is happening and also exciting and giving us reason to be angry at what is going on not only in the film, but in real life as well. the film passes all these check points and exceeds abundantly in each of these areas. money monster is one of the most entertaining thrill rides of the year, but it is not an empty movie. it is filled with good thoughts and questions that need to be asked and will rally any individual who has ever been questioned, or burned, or just plain angry about the things mentioned earlier in the review. the film has great and sharp dialogue and not just one dimensional characters, but very interesting characters who are great pawns in this giant chess game of a film. the film has a strong message and will leave you thinking about it's message, but will keep you riveted while doing so. one of the best times at the films so far this year and i look forward to seeing more of foster as a director and hope clooney and cast continue to shine in other films because they are all on the top of their game here."", ""jodie foster did a good job keeping money monster realistic and moving, and all players came across as credible, and the nyc financial district and nypd formed a solid backdrop to the action. clooney and roberts put in their usual strong performances, but the standout was o'connell. i'd also give kudos to the guy who played a tv cameraman and had some of the best lines. the action was such that the first two thirds of the film kept me at the edge of my seat. only in the last third did the plot fall apart a bit with a overly complex explanation of the incident that provoked the rest of the story. but we'll give it a pass because the rest of the effort was so well done. a solid 7, maybe a bit more.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMjU1NDUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg1NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg,Financial TV host Lee Gates and his producer Patty are put in an extreme situation when an irate investor takes them and their crew as hostage.

i watched the movie totally unmoved. i remember an old movie with a similar approach to the story of christ's resurrection - the robe directed by henry koster and in the role of the tribune marcellus gallio the great richard burton. if i compare those two movies i will always prefer the flick from 1953. whereas the transition of the tribune in the robe showed the inner conflict of a roman officer in changing his belief, his view on the world, the transition in risen is not really compellingconvincing. the best part of the movie is a battle between romans and hebrew insurgents at the beginning. the production value of risen is good, but really bad is the soundtrack - it sounds like sth made for a tv or dvd-directly-production. in short risen is not that bad, but i myself was a little bored watching. someone else already noted in hisher review - some of those jesus younger behaved in some scenes like stoned hippies, which i watched with a chuckle. some of these scenes had a little of the flavor of montys life of brian. i guess this reaction of me andor that layer of comic was not really intended by the director because in a whole i would sum up the flick as belonging to those kinds of movies who tend to be propaganda for the christian belief."", ""i liked this movie, even with some of its faults depicting a time in history. i specially like that they chose the resurrection, because we already have many options about the passion. and in fashion with all the crime scene investigation on tv here a roman tribune investigates what happened to the body of christ that the romans expected to remain buried, but somehow the tomb was opened and empty. as a story for the screen it is entertaining and with convincing scenarios most of the time, as well as good acting. the research does show in uniforms, the tomb, houses and furniture of those times, and a few aspects of the jewish temple. the research is only half done about geographical locations in galilee, which this production unfortunately depicts as a desert near an ocean or about the contents of the bible details like who were the real witnesses, what the apostles really said, etc. but oh well, it's literary license and enjoyable as is.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNjQ1Mzk2MjNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU0MDk1Mjcx._V1_.jpg,"In 33 AD, a Roman Tribune in Judea is tasked to find the missing body of Jesus Christ, who rose from the dead."

marcus logan lerman  and his struggles with love and religion. although his parents jewish,  marcus is an atheist and often is at odds with his family, school, and  community. however, when he meets another student named olivia hutton  sarah gadon, everything changes.  the movie does an excellent job of portraying the challenging ethical  and romantic complications marcus has to face in his daily life. his  character is extremely well- developed and well-written as he has  moments of self-doubt, self-discovery, and emotional conflict. although  the movie does have moments of humor, its general tone is somber.  overall, the riveting movie's simple premise is elevated by the great  chemistry between the leading actors and the immersing quality of the  filmography. as marcus tries to discover who he wants to be in life, we  get a chance to reflect on who we are as well. at its heart, the movie  is a captivating journey that explores its protagonist's identity and  goals in a heartfelt way.  lj's grade b"", ""i had no idea what the actual premise for this film was, but i did think it would be a period melodrama that could also prove to be overly sentimental and a little sappy. however, it really surprised me in what it actually turned out to be. it's a coming-of-age take that is different from most that we get. it's very dialogue-driven and that dialogue is just a joy to listen to. the film takes a deep look into the characters' psychologies and doesn't resort to the usual dramatics that films of this type usually do. logan lerman is an incredibly talented actor and he once again shows his skill here. a mature and very detailed performance."", 'so much darkness and despair. a young man from a jewish family goes to college, but he himself is an atheist but attends a conservative college where chapel is mandatory. boy meets sexually adventurous girl. boy is unsure what to think of said girl, but continues receiving hand and mouth favors from said girl. girl jumps down the mental rabbit hole, again boy is unsure what to think or do. by the end of the film i was just glad it was over. not since ordinary people have i seen such a large amount of the plot revolve around sexual gratification. skip it.', ""roth always writes about talented people who ruined their lives or had bad luck. his books that made to movies are always very well casted and the performances are great. indignation is the story of a conflicted jewish young man who could have a great future ahead if he didn't meet a spoiled disturbed woman whose only way to relate to man was through sex. there was not one single meaningful intelligent dialogue between of them. it was about sex. i am not sure about what was the message roth was trying to send to us. the book and the movie would be great if the had focused in marcus rebellion against the status quo. marcus as a rebel was an amazing character. marcus as the object of a disturbed spoiled woman was pathetic. i realize i don't relate to roth stories. it is not the winner takes it all, but there is no winner in roth's world."", ""rating ½ out of 5   this film is highly recommended.   in brief an underrated film that deserves to be seen...one of the  year's best dramas.  grade a-  synopsis in 1951, a young jewish man goes to college to avoid the  korean war and falls in love with serious consequences.  jim's review based on philip roth's novel, indignation tells the  familiar story of a young repressed jewish man falling in love or  lust with a beautiful gentile woman in the 1950's era. a rehash of  goodbye columbus without the comic edge and irony, this film follows a  similar outline by the same author, but is far more solemn and serious  in its treatment. this is typical roth territory in which our hero will  try to overcome the obstacles placed in his path as fate deals its  upper hand.  marcus messner logan lerman is an intellectual loner. yearning to  escape from his domineering jewish family, he goes off to a  conservative christian college rather than fighting in the korean war.  it is there he meets olivia sarah gadon, a beautiful blonde vision of  loveliness and their first date leads to a budding romance. it is also  there that he encounters an omnipotent and powerful head dean, dean  caudwell tracy letts, in a powerful performance, but more on that  later, who has great difficulty coming to terms with this all too  rational and radical student and avowed atheist.  the screenplay adaptation by james schamus, who also directed the film,  is first rate. it allows the characters to intellectualize their  philosophies with such eloquence. the film starts off a bit too  leisurely but establishes characters and place so effortlessly. the  film structure begins as a flashback with narrative voice-over that  doesn't really make much sense until its full circle ending, with one  of the most powerful closing shots that emotionally left me gasp. mr.  schamus' literate script aligns with his skillful direction, as this  talented filmmaker captures the mindset of this nostalgic but troubled  era in an understated fashion. speaking of fashions, the costume  design by the gifted ann roth is a visual treat as well.  about the midway point, there is a remarkable dramatic scene that  highlights the glorious direction, screenplay, and acting unlike any  other film thus far this year. it is a rather lengthy confrontation  between our idealist liberal young hero sparring with a smug  conservative dean. the teacher becomes intellectually inferior to his  student as their conversation continues. the tension builds ominously  and slowly in this cat-and mouse gamesmanship, maneuvering from one  point of view to the next. it is startling its its subtlety and impact.  simply put, it is the highlight of this film and one of the most  engrossing scenes one will see this year in any film.  the acting is superb. mr. lerman as marcus is perfectly cast and  carries off the innocence of youth angle in this coming-of-age tale.  this actor commands the screen and makes his character quite believable  and caring. his love interest played by ms. gadon definitely looks the  part, but her acting skills never reach the depth of her written  character. she needed to be that 50's female icon, a grace kelly type,  but comes off as a second-tier kim novak or a third -rate cybil  shepard. she's good, but not good enough when compared to the stellar  acting by others in this movie. the film is populated with top-notch  broadway veterans in supporting roles who certainly know their way  around a script. danny burstein plays marcus' over-protective father  and he is so strong in his nuanced acting that one wishes he had more  screen time. adding fine support in smaller roles are ben rosenfield  and pico anderson.   but there are two truly great performances that deserve award  recognition linda emond as esther, marcus' loving mother, who has a  wonderful speech as she tries to steer her son into making the right  decision. it is delivered with such skill and passion. tracy leets as  the egotistical and bigoted dean caudwell, is a marvel, creating one of  the most terrifying teacher role models since j.k. simmon's sadistic  teacher in whiplash. the hatred and intolerance of others is so  condensed in mr. leets' body language and facial expressions that the  end results counteract his words in the most unsettling manner. oscar  voters, are you listening?  the film's theme about life' s choices, about the road we take or did  not take, about the small detours that can have consequences which will  eternally haunt our existence, is foremost in this thought-provoking  story. mr. schamus has made an compelling case with his wonderful  debut, indignation. let us hope this independent film makes a  compelling reason with the movie-going audience for compulsory viewing  and is not lost amid the blockbusters and cinematic hyperbole that is  usually the par for the summer course. run to see this film while you  can! it demands your attention!"", 'what can i say? this movie started out like a seemingly carefree experience about college life in the repressed early 1950s. somewhere along the line, it does a complete about face and becomes an extremely serious take on pre-material sex, interfaith romance,the belief or lack of in god, the misfortunes of war and destiny. the performances were all outstanding and captured the morals and the social structure of the early 1950s. at times, some scenes were a bit long and slightly dull, but this reflects on the concept of this film....life can be dull and boring until one opens up their being to new experiences. wuthout giving the ending away, it is a surprise and extremely depressing. i like happy endings and unfortunately, this film ending ranks as one of the most depressing in film history. still, if you love great acting, see this film. 10 out

suburban dudes who somehow find themselves acting like thuggish, grizzled killers to retrieve a stolen kitten the titular keanu. it's a terrible screenplay, but at least the laughs are there for the first act. after that, it falls into endless re-hashes, basically telling the same two or three jokes against a different backdrop for the length of the picture. i loved these guys on tv, but keanu doesn't do a great job of highlighting their versatility and eventually goes beyond satire to become exactly the type of movie they're lampooning. would've made a hilarious five-minute fake trailer on the small screen, which may shine a light on the type of growing pains to expect if they continue this transition to feature-length material."", ""i needed to watch something that would make me laugh, and who other than key  peele. if you like their skits, then this movie is for you. oh and the kitten is pretty adorable too and i don't say that often."", ""comedy is subjective. trying to explain why something does or doesn't make you laugh is like trying to explain why you think certain foods are delicious how do you make someone experience your experience? for example, the sketch show key  peele, while often a smart satire on race and sex, was simply and inexplicably hilarious to me. on the other hand, keanu, a film created and starring the same dudes, has arguably nowhere near the laughs. despite some all-in comedic performances from two of the most talented guys around, it simply isn't very funny. through a series of unfortunate events, two mild-mannered men go looking for a kitten and find themselves in the midst of a war between competing drug gangs. key and peele display the same comedy-in-sync-ness they became famous for, and they deserve a vehicle much better than this to display their skill. unfortunately the movie itself never quite finds its balance. it's an absurdist comedy that feels both too absurd and not absurd enough. the plot is shoddy at best, and the shallow levels of character give way to whatever joke seems to be funniest at that moment. none of that would matter, of course, if i just found the movie more consistently funny. not that it's devoid lol moments key and peele both have a knack for putting a twist on a line or a facial expression to give it an added layer of wit i.e. how they act when they think they're about to be killed. unfortunately, they have created such anticipation through years of brilliant tv work, anything less than wall-to-wall guffaws can be a disappointment."", ""keanu is a comedy film about nerdy friends who disguise as gangsters to steal their kitten. the film stars jordan peele and keegan-michael key, best known for their comedy central sketch series key  peele. they play rell, the besotted owner of keanu the kitten, and his uptight george michael-loving cousin clarence. the film has a geeky, film-literate flavor to some of the humor, which defuses the semi-ironic gangster posturing. a cameo from anna faris is unexpected and not entirely successful. the central joke, that even the most ruthless underworld drug wholesalers are putty in the paws of an adorably cute kitten, is a good one but not enough to sustain an entire movie. the film is intended for the duo's loyal fans, introducing them to a wider audience, and directing at children. however, the movie is a weirdly generic fish-out-of-water tale, where bungling cowards impersonate tough guys, familiar territory for male comedy duos past and present. key and peele play their familiar, nerdy suburban characters, with clarence being a mild-mannered people-pleaser and his cousin rell being a single, stoner artist and graphic designer. keanu, played by a team of seven kittens, fills the hole in clarence's heart and becomes his artistic muse. the film's chemistry is one of its main assets, and the central joke, that even the most ruthless underworld drug wholesalers are putty in the paws of an adorably cute kitten, is a good one but not enough to sustain an entire movie. key  peele, a group known for their roles in hollywood comedy, can act outside of their signature characters. their intense friendship and individual personalities draw viewers in, but their bromance is absent in this show. the characters play it straight, with little frisson between them, and their black nerdiness is neglected. keanu has potential, but the code-switching shtick becomes tiresome and neglects their black nerdiness. however, the team works to translate representations of black masculine anger and impenetrability into comedy, revealing the adorable kittens underneath the swagger. the film also satisfied the guilty pleasure of rappersactors, with method acting man defying the adage of avoiding performances with children or animals. overall, key  peele's performance is enjoyable and satisfying, despite the potential for more mature roles. keanu is a film about a family of gang members who are chased by the 17th street blips, a savage gang of former bloods and crips. the cousins, led by will forte, pursue the kitten into the urban underworld of l. a., where they bond with the blips and battle drug kingpins and a crime duo. the film has only a single comic narrative setup and extended joke, which is part of the problem with the film. while key  peele are appealing on the big screen, the film feels declawed and lacks anything we haven't seen before, except for the kitten. the production feels televisual, staged in enclosed spaces like cars, clubs, and rooftops. the cousins visit urban spaces explored in their program, such as the club, strip joints, back alleys, and vacant lots. however, the hood and neighborhood are flat, missing the playful surrealism that animates these quotidian urban and suburban spaces and the eccentric characters that occupy them in the show."", ""the premise is a little stretched in parts, but there's some really great comedy bits in here. devolves into an action movie at the end, but they kind of had themselves backed into a corner. they didn't take themselves too seriously overall, so you can overlook the fact that key suddenly became a great shot and had no problem killing after a movie of being chicken. this was a decent comedy and worth watching."", ""keanu makes an effort to combine humor and action with a feline twist, offering moments of true humor along with a novel idea centered around an adorable kitten. the picture is enhanced by the humorous chemistry of keegan-michael key and jordan peele, who play a main pair whose comedic timing is consistently spot-on. nevertheless, the plot falters and often veers into familiar ground as it tries to keep its pace. even though there are some laughs throughout the film's running period, the humor with a cat theme might not be enough. although there is potential for improvement in the general plot and pacing, keanu's charm is found in its lighter moments. fans of key and peele's humorous approach might find enough fun in this oddball, cat-filled trip, despite its uneven outcomes."", ""i'm not sure what people are after when looking for comedy. people have different views on what makes a belly laugh or just a smirk. for me this was just what i needed at the time, yes it's silly and yes it's not a serious action movie but it did make me laugh, so it's a 6 from me."", ""a couple of inoffensive cousins rell williams, keegan-michael key get mixed up in a murderous gangsta turf war and a related violent 'custody' battle over a kitten keanu, voiced briefly by keanu reeves. the core premise is amusing no matter how vicious and malignant they are, all of the criminals love the kitten but is too slender to stretch into a full-length movie. most of the scenes go on too long and after a while everything starts to look and sound the same. the plot, which essentially buttresses a single joke, doesn't make a lot of sense and the final 'twist' is a bit of a stretch even for a farce. considering the heightened racial sensitivities these days early 2020, it is interesting to see a film where the 'n-word' features so prominently as a comic tool supporting 'context is everything' arguments i guess. the cast is quite good, especially williams and key, and as a counter-point farce superimposing ultra-cute on ultra-violence, the film is moderately successful, but in the end, i only found it fitfully amusing but other than liking cats, i doubt that i'm in the target

for de niro and efron and i can not in my wildest dreams understand why this movie got green light... i can laugh at funny sexual jokes, but this was at a level of 5 year old's. complete waste of money and the actor's and my time... unless the actors actually found it funny, and in that case i must admit i am a bit surprised and disappointed. besides the large amount of bad jokes, stupid, unfunny characters, an appalling backstory and completely flat non-engaging character developments, the writing is also completely worthless. there is nothing really wrong with the actors performances, maybe even better that one would expect considering the material they had to work with. maybe they all had a good time making the movie and getting a few laughs at work, but the result was no laughing matter, i am sorry to say."", 'so comedies are a sensitive subject to the general population and especially in this day and age, you have to watch what is said because everyone is suddenly so sensitive. well, to start this section off, i will genuinely say that if you do not appreciate vulgar r-rated comedies, do not see this movie. on another note, i thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. dirty grandpa presents robert de niro in a way mostly never seen before. he rips out insults and jokes like he is a freshly turned 21-year-old in a 72- year-old body. zac presents himself as a very uptight and by-the- book lawyer that has a free-spirited past that he has since lost due to the strictness of his father yet as soon as that uptight side is broken, this film is a wild ride as the two tear apart the beaches of florida. this movie is purely a joke film, the story is forced in for the sake of film but it still works, kind of. nonetheless, if you want to watch a very vulgar comedy and want to watch a 72-year- old like never seen before, this is the comedy to watch to start off your year. raunchy inappropriateness at its finest.', ""this might be a great movie for some audiences, obviously there are enough people who like such things, considering that they keep making them and they become box-office hits. this movie relies on the typical american exclusive sensation, on its dirtiness and dark humour. i'm a person who is able to take a joke and understands dark humour, but this movie is purely dirty, banal and unfunny. many of the actors are overacting in their characters' dirtiness. it is pretty much a messed up commercial sht like ted 2, except that at least there is not a living teddy bear married to a slutty drug addict thank god. it's lame how they mix up the banal sentimental moments with the tasteless humour and the totally disgusting dirty moments which are supposed to be entertaining. it's full of movies like this that have banal plots plus random dumb moments filled with massive drug use. other than that, it's well-shot. at least this we could expect to be nice. it's not too bad if we take the fact i watched it at home and managed to watch until the end."", ""this is really the funniest movie i've ever seen. it literally gave me the chills from the beginning until the very end. and this is not just my opinion the whole cinema was laughing so hard sometimes i couldn't hear the lines so i had to read them. i think the scriptwriter did a fantastic job. the cast was also absolutely amazing. the mix with zac efron's talent and robert de niro's experience worked out great. they really had chemistry between them. i think everything about this movie worked grade from the title to to very credits. future project that include zac efron will definitely be top material. it also seems that robert de niro did not lost his touch when it comes to comedy."", ""most grandpa's just want toffee.

and entertaining to watch, but this one had de niro which seemed very odd to me. i have to admit, he was very very funny in this and brought something that most characters in movies like this don't. believability in the serious aspects. the jokes are really nothing new, but de niro delivering them make them that much funnier and i laughed a lot through out, hard. all of the actors had great timing in this, efron and de niro had good chemistry but aubrey plaza really shines and if not for de niro would have stolen the movie. this is nothing all that original but it feels new and fresh with the addition of de niro and is very much worth seeing for that reason. overall, de niro really shows his range from godfather 2 to raging bull to goodfellas to this one...and he again shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. i give this a b."", ""awful, awful comedy, but i love some of the actors in it so i had a morbid curiosity. honestly, the script just plain sucks. i have no clue why robert de niro whom i didn't watch it for, by the way - his judgement has been so bad for the past 20 years you can just assume his movies are going to suck would sign onto this. you have to admire his commitment, but the whole old-person-has-potty-mouth act was old decades ago. plus, it's not just that he's dirty, he's mostly unlikable. the biggest problem with the film is that it's saddled with the hoary dude is marrying a bitch trope, which is always lame and fairly sexist. funny thing is, the other girl zac efron falls for in the film, zoey deutch the cutey from everybody wants some!!, is every bit as boring as the girl he's engaged to julianna hough. efron himself isn't too bad as the straight man, but he works better in goofier roles. i saw this mainly for aubrey plaza. she's hot as hell in this movie, and has some funny line readings, but i'm just too squicked out by her lust for robert de niro. i almost threw up in my mouth a couple of times. so yeah, almost everything here sucks, but there are two big exceptions jason mantzoukas and adam pally. mantzoukas plays a nutty drug dealer named pam it's a nickname. it's short for pamela and he brings a lot of life to the picture whenever he pops up. pally happy endings, the mindy project doesn't get as much to do, but he gets a laugh even with the smallest line, and he has the movie's best gag as he has to act as a messenger between efron and hough at their wedding. i'd almost say it's worth watching just for mantzoukas and pally if you're a fan of either of them. the rest of it is bad, but i've seen far worse."", 'a good movie having a genuine plot. its not like those comedy movies who offer only comedy but now plots, its worth watching , quite entertaining scenes in the movie to keep you in it.

with you, leaving you to turn it over and over in your mind long after its credits have rolled. it's a constantly evolving experience, moving through several somewhat distinct acts defined only by your understanding of its plot's events. this is evidence of its keen awareness of its audience, as it is able to predict what you're thinking in order to set up a blindsiding reveal. a lot of the narrative is ambiguous, despite a fairly concrete end, and it makes for an extremely enigmatic watch, one in which your assumptions are always shifting and, somehow, never quite correct. when you think back on the piece, you realise how meticulously crafted it is right from the opening shot. it's exactly what it needs to be, even if it does sometimes seem slightly meandering and you can certainly feel its length. it's never even close to boring, constantly keeping you engaged and occasionally wrenching you to the edge of your seat. it's the kind of film that sneaks up on you you don't realise your heart is in your mouth until it's too late. it's as much a mystery as it is a horror, but it's ultimately rather frightening. it has moments of wince-inducing gore, creepy imagery and unbearable tension but it's its overall effect that affects you the most. it's difficult to describe, really, but to say the picture is ominous is an understatement. its only real flaw is the fact that some of its odd comedy, particularly in its earlier sequences, detracts ever-so-slightly from the sincerity of its narrative. still, even this contributes to the story's decidedly off-kilter vibe. when it comes down to it, the thing is absolutely brilliant, a distinct and distinguished movie unlike most others of its kind. it gets under your skin and wriggles around for a long time.

from a mysterious diseases which seems like some kind of virus and this ends up killing them, and in the middle of somewhere a japanese stranger seems to be involved in this. now, i'm not going to say more than that about the story , and i suggest you to not watch the trailer which doesn't do justice to the movie and stay away from any possible spoiler. it is one of the best horror movies i have seen in long time, it doesn't have jump scares. but what this movie does, it slowly grows on you, you will be confused, conflicted, disgusted while watching this. somewhere you will make a choice, a perspective to the way things are going and possibly will be wrong. so i strongly suggest you to watch this movie if possible in a secluded environment and if possible alone. p.s.- it has the what i

wanted to know more about what i had just watched. however, after taking time to reflect and review some of the interpretations that have been put out there, i've decided that the wailing didn't quite meet my expectations. it was hard to follow, and most people seem to understand that the director wanted some things to be intentionally vague. but what bothered me is that i felt like the story kept introducing new plot points that didn't seem connected to what had come before. when i got to the end and saw what other people had to say about what was going on, it didn't do anything to deepen my appreciation of the movie. it's long, too, and it feels like it meanders, even if everything does somehow tie together at the end. i just didn't respond that strongly to it. i think some of the

good work of bollywood is on the road with increasing the speed and performance. yes, i'm talking about akshay kumar starer airlift, directed by raja krishna menon, and which is based on true events! film starts in kuwait. rajiv katyal akki has been reached on the top level in business with his ability. he refers himself as a kuwait citizen. but when the government leaves their citizens when iraq attacks on kuwait under the order of saddam hussain, the people becomes needless. rajiv now feels that he is an indian, and so along with other 1,70,000 people who are actually indians but lives in kuwait, he starts the mission to run from kuwait as soon as possible. his tries, his communication to india for the help, and the officer's help from india - these things you can find out in this movie. some factors, like emotions of love for the family, for the nation, for the coworkers and their relatives, for the people who are only belongs to the same nation, have been described very well. many moments where we can feel patriotism. raja has directed a superb film. akshay has given a stunning performance as usual. i was comparing baby film with this, but both are different. but if you ask for just one movie, than i'll go with this one. nimrat kaur is my favorite since the lunchbox and dairy milk commercials. she has delivered a fine supportive job. she shines as a wife of a rich businessman and a caring mother. kumud mishra fits absolutely in the character of a government officer. poorab kohli has a small role. supportive cast are fine, too. de di and soch na sake are very small songs. perfectly situated. tu bhula jise is the song to remember. background score suits to the film. dialogues are good. nimrat's 34 minuets long conversation with a unsatisfied man of the camp who always complains, is a must! cinematography is good. some scenes give are shaky, those could have been shoot better. editing is fine. indian flag has been waved by an airport staff of jordan and akki is watching that, while tu bhula jise song is playing - the scene has been brought so many whistles and shouts. and than one more, in which air india plane is taking off, while akki is watching that and in background vande mataram is playing - a truly emotional scene! it will surely gives you goosebumps! overall, a must watch movie for every indians, to know the largest human evacuation.

treasured. airlift is a real story where humanity is celebrated, and a movie on humanity needs to strike the right chord to enter the audience's hearts. and this one very memorably goes! akshay kumar gives his heart and soul to the role and is a huge reason why the movie achieves its heights. the screenplay and direction are top notch, and the music is very hum worthy. and best thing, it felt like it ended early as audiences were wanting more. seriously indian cinema standards will take a rise more with this movie. highly recommended watch!"", ""airlift is simply a great movie whether you talk about direction or acting,its simply mind blowing. akshay kumar's gritty acting is simply mesmerizing.unlike other movies , songs of this movie are soothing and full of melody. its great that they

bringing alive a city over-run and under siegesends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel- producing bollywood.other than that nimrat kaur's was also very good. overall, 'airlift' is a good film,solidly plotted, well executed and well- acted. a must watch. its a perfect movie for republic day week !"", ""over the years akshay kumar's choice of selecting the films has  certainly improved with significant examples being holiday, baby,  special chabbis, gabbar is back to name few. move over commercial  masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single  blow and typical song-dance routine  raja menon's airlift will give  you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.  based on a true story, airlift speaks about the ranjit katyal played  by akshay kumar who helps the indian government collaborate with air  india to help evacuate 1,70,000 indians from kuwait after iraq raided  the country.  from the director of critical acclaimed films like bas yun hi and barah  aana, raja menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even  recorded in the guinness book of world record and surprisingly people  are unaware about it. airlift will consume you right from the beginning  especially when akshay's family faces the issue of iraqi raiding  kuwait. from here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives  you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. icing on  the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. on the flip  side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. but  brilliant screenplay, art direction and cinematography is spellbinding.  background score gels well with the mood of the film. dialogues are  fine. the music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. the  soulful number such as 'soch na sake' is already a superhit among the  viewers. besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.  it is akshay kumar's show all the way. a thumbs up to him for doing  something different from his usual masala potboilers. after giving  back-to-back hits in 2015 with baby, gabbar is back and singh is  bliing, akshay kumar is definitely on a roll. with holiday, baby and  now airlift, akshay kumar has managed to create a image of mera bharat  mahaan actor and fans will love him in new avatar. the fresh pairing  of akshay kumar and nimrat kaur works well. nimrat kaur's realistic  subtlety would harness akshay kumar's machismo and give us that perfect  thriller  overall , airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is  going to give you goose bumps. brilliant 4.55"", 'airlift is the best film of akshay kumar till date. the story is all about a business man in kuwaitakshay thinks that he is also a kuwaiti. but when

been brutal but makers kept it very balanced. one scene where lead actor scuffles with iraqi soldiers is a note above but its culmination again makes it worth clapping. performance wise akhshay kumar

khalaf bin zayd, is first rate. he had gone deep into character that its hard to believe that he is an indian. his balanced greed in eyes and accent make his character believable. kumud mishra as secretary sanjeev kohli is impressive. purab kohli as abraham makes his presence felt. ajay arya singh as akshay kumar first driver is fine in his brief role. feryana wazheir as kuwaiti girl, tasneem

speaking numerically i stepped in to expect to give an 8 after interval i thought to give 6 and after the movie i'm giving an 7. the things that i liked about the movie was obviously acting by akshay kumar, because he wasn't loud like his previous movies, purab kohl was midas as always. technically the movie felt good, the story concept was good, characterization was average, because there were too many character. the things that i didn't like about the movie was that actresses like nimrat kaur and feryna wazheir weren't utilized properly, it was the first time i saw nimrat kaur on screen after hearing praises about her, but i was let down as she felt as an rich punjabi housewife nothing else, feryna wazheir's a talented theater actress and her talent wasn't used properly either. the other thing is too many malyalee character representations, even the role of there general felt to be a bit on funny side instead of the serious one. bottom line you should obviously go to see this

reason most of the critics have rated the film 4 out of 5 stars which clearly shows that not only audience but critics are also in support of airlift. very few analysts or critics have given somewhat

and right ratings from experts and viewers not from a particular or single place but from all over the world.looking at this rating,i seriously doubt the entire indian cinema ratings and would rather skip than waste my time and energy to go through any of the high rated movies and would skip the ones that do not even reach 5.this is my personal opinion but all i'm saying is the fans are not doing

union giving the best performance of her career and nate parker giving...well, a performance. the problems here lie with the film itself. the story plays like a more realistic version of django unchained, even lifting some inspiration from that film a little too heavily for the scenes in which the slaves are beaten and abused. however, the film also delves into the religious aspects of turner so heavy handedly that it borders along the fine line of a parody more often than not. the other film that parker must have had playing on his tablet while directing some scenes is braveheart because, the last battle in particular, is riddled with countless homages to that film that border plagiarism. between the way parker conveys his violence and the way he immortalizes nat turner by making him more of a saint than he ought to be, the film gradually feels less and less genuine as the running time winds down. that was my biggest gripe with the film honestly. nate parker failed to convey anything human about nat turner outside of him witnessing the brutalization that went on around him. there is something divine in the way parker conveys turner and it is just too much for a film that is steeped in this much history and realism. it fails to accurately portray to rebellion as it happened. there are very few mentions of what the rebellion actually did in reality as opposed to what it did in the film. while i am not saying that turner's rebellion was without cause, the film dilutes the harsh realities of what turner's rebellion did. in a sense, i felt it was a bit disrespectful to the victims of his rebellion both black and white. with that being said, this is a film and not a documentary, so there is some room for some creative liberties, within reason. however, this does stand as nate parker's first directorial effort and, for a first film, it is a damn fine effort that should lead to more work as a director. despite this fact, it still is nowhere near enough to sustain this as a film worthy of accolades and praise. quite frankly, there is a lot wrong with the film. the pacing is either mind-numbingly slow or so quickly cut and erratic that you can barely grasp what is going on. also, the extreme close shots are so constant and abundant that it is just another contributing factor to it feeling very incoherent. the story is bland and has been done before and done better despite this being nat turner's first on-screen portrayal, the story has inspired many films that have come out in recent years such as the previously mentioned django unchained. the sound design, at least on the sundance version that i saw, was very flat and felt a bit too post-production sounding. despite all this, i can't fully write this film off. there are some truly powerful performances in the film and some well done battle sequences to enjoy but other than that, this is an average film."", ""birth of a nation is nate parker's directorial debut and i was initially sceptical about watching this film after the harsh criticism it received and the controversy around the portrayal of the events. the best way to describe this one for anybody that is not aware of the plot is django unchained meets 12 years a slave although toned down slightly in budget and quality of direction. i loved this film a lot and the vision and passion that nate parker conveys with the script is unparalleled. something that i was very concerned about with this film is whether or not it would fall into the trap of the free state of jones because many audiences complained that it was too long and boring however this film is consistently interesting and thought provoking from start to finish. unfortunately, the editing throughout felt extremely rushed. it was almost as if they were scared to leave the camera on a character too long in case the audience lost interest and the editing is overall very sloppy which is one of the major flaws with the picture. i would have loved to see them take their time with the shots and extend the film to the 160  170-minute mark to allow for further character development but i understand why they didn't because of the hatred that previous similar films received. for the first hour of the film, it wasn't very emotionally captivating and i struggled to relate to the characters a lot. the film also loses its footing and trips over common clichés within the biographical war drama period piece films which takes away some of the innovation presented by the mostly superb cinematography. the characters should have been given more freedom to traverse the world as they often felt detached from the setting and environment of the film due to a lack of interaction. the film also features some very thought provoking metaphorical imagery although it often feels very forced and doesn't blend well with the structure of the narrative. an additional flaw with the film was that i felt that nate parker was trying way too hard in this role and was seriously desperate for acting recognition. that's perfectly understandable as this is his directorial debut although he has often quite obviously constructed scenes that allow him to stand out and seem the superior actor in relation to the rest of the cast. moving away from criticisms on the film, what i thought it did really well was to eliminate the stigma surrounding historical settings in the film industry today where average movie goers often associate historical events as boring and tedious and i honestly can't imagine anybody being genuinely bored at this film. it just moves so fast and the events are truly brutal and relentless. some of the scenes in this film are excruciatingly hard to watch and the film isn't scared to push the boundaries of the 15 certification. this really worked to its advantage to show the horrifying events although some viewers will be turned off by the onslaught of violence and torture. the personal peak of the film for me was the score. so expertly chosen to reflect the actions on screen and breathe life into scenes that are otherwise quite bland. the music really worked for me and there wasn't too much to the point where it felt like a music video much like other titles this year suicide squad. the gore and injury detail is so well realised, absolutely horrific and shocking leaving some scenes cemented into audiences minds for days after watching the film. there was a singular scene towards the end of the film that absolutely floored me with its gruelling depiction of violence and rebellion which was followed by an uplifting and inspiring resolution and overall this film gave me way more than i could have hoped for or was expecting. the birth of a nation  7.810"", ""you got purpose, its in you. nat turner parker is a different type of slave. he is literate and a preacher. he is treated better than most slaves and remains calm and obedient. when he begins to speak to other slaves around the south he notices mistreatment and worse. no longer able to stand by and do nothing he leads a slave revolt that ends up changing the country. going in i was expecting another brutal slave movie along the lines of 12 years a slave. while it did not shy away from the horror of slavery it was more about the reasons that led up to the uprising and had more of a free state of jones feel than 12 years a slave. that fact alone made this easier to watch. i'm not 100 sure how historically accurate the movie is but it is a movie that should be seen and understood. things like this can happen and people can take a stand not based on how they are treated, but how they see others treated. that is an important lesson. overall, easier to watch than 12 years a slave and one that is very much worth seeing, but nothing earth shattering either. i give this a b."", ""the birth of nation tells the story of nat turner as he treks through his life of brutality and slavery at the hands of brutal plantation owners in 19th century southern america only to lead a slave rebellion to exact revenge on his oppressors. first off, this film is shrouded in controversy and hype while masking itself with the notion that this is an important film. in the hands of a more capable director, the birth of a nation could have been a truly mesmerizing film but nate parker's overly ambitious and slightly egotistical vision is hard to swallow for all the wrong reasons. the film starts with young nat turner playing with the son of his slave master, samuel. nat is a special boy as he learns to read and write at a young age with the help of his slave owner elizabeth turner penelope ann miller. from that point on, we see nat turner nate parker and samuel turner armie hammer as adults. the two are friends but nat must still walk on egg shells due to his status as a slave. the story progresses very slowly, showing samuel in a financial bind and nat living a comfortable life with all things considering with his wife cherry. samuel eventually exploits nat as a preacher to the slaves and even makes money off of him as a preacher of gospel in order to keep the slaves docile and calm. as he is carted off to multiple plantations for sermons, he sees the horrors of slavery first-hand and decides, after a brutal fictious rape on cherry, to rebel and cause an uprising. the film is a sad one. it is sad because of slavery, because of the brutality, yes...but the saddest part of the birth of a nation is the idea of what could have been. the film is a vicious display of violence and brutality with a one-sided and very historically inaccurate story. while many people are not privy to nat turner's rebellion, it still does not excuse the poorly constructed storyline based around the idea of a rape and religious visions in order to fuel the nat turner character's motives as if parker was not confident enough in telling the true life story and the real reasons behind why turner rebelled. much like this year's free state of jones, the birth of a nation screenplay is haphazard and very amateur in its execution. the women characters are mere pawns that have little to no dialog and the dialog they are given is so unsubstantial that it lessens the impacts of their actions...especially when the cherry character's rape is such an integral part to parker's telling of the story. the acting is powerful at times and parker gives a good performance but it is a performance that you can't take seriously at moments. he is an actor that can have you tear up in one scene and unintentionally laugh at another whether it is because of a line delivery or some of his overly dramatic scowls. gabrielle union, who plays esther, the muted rape victim is also amazing in her role. armie hammer also shows glimpses of a great performance especially because his character had a much more interesting sub-plot to delve into and the film really never gave it a second thought outside of a single scene scored to overtly dramatic music. the filmmaking is the downfall here. the birth of a nation is painfully slow in its first hour and very chaotic in its second. it reeks of an inexperienced filmmaker and left me genuinely surprised especially because of the hype that we've heard about this film. honestly, i've seen history channel specials with better productions. the blue tint is overbearing, the actual camera work is too close and honed in on its subjects, the sound is flat and the editing is so erratic that it's very hard to keep track of what's going on. overall, the birth of a nation is less 12 years a slave and more free state of jones. it may be an important story but it is far from an important film."", ""this was a tough movie to get through. not because of it's inability to keep me enthralled, but rather due to the it's in your face portrayal of the early lives of african american slaves in the usa. we have all read and watched movies based in this time and subject. the brutality and victimization is ours to deal with and reflect upon. the movie flows well from beginning to end. the characters are well thought out and develop cleanly in the film. the dialogue seemed sometimes forced and coercive but nonetheless keeps true to itself. the scenes of immense degradation were tough to view but essential to the plot and the movie. i commend the fact that the title birth of a nation was reclaimed in a movie about strength and fortitude rather than it's predecessor of cowardice and fear.""]",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MjI3NzQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUwNjYyOTE@._V1_.jpg,"Nat Turner, a literate slave and preacher in the antebellum South, orchestrates an
