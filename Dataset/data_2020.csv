the grudge,Horror Mystery Thriller,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391198/,"['metaphysical horror movie. grudge was the beginning of a great franchise, from which many more films were inspired. like franschise rings, grudge relies on japanese films ju-on, 2000 and with its unique concept and style, they are a distinct kind of horror films in themselves. so according to tradition, if a violent death occurs, then the wrath of the victim will fall on the scene as a curse that will haunt everything in that area. the film is quite well-written, with very good effects, intensity and suspense from start to finish and does not get boring at all. the script, the directing, but also the actors were all excellent and are definitely among the most classic films in the genre, but also a reference film. definitely in the top recommended horror movies.', ""do you like intelligently-written suspense and horror films? then the grudge is not for you. this film has a paper-thin plot, barely makes sense, shoddy-looking special effects, overused flashbacks, lackluster performances, and ultimately makes the ring look like a masterpiece. bill pullman was grossly underutilized, albeit scanty screen-time was written that way in the script for him. i just can't believe sam raimi produced this film, because even the evil dead films blow this film away. i was one of three people in the theater viewing this film, and the other two left before the film was over. stay far, far away from this movie. it is definitely not worth shelling out money for. this film leaves too many unanswered questions, including why this film was made."", ""creepy ghostly phantasms appear out of nowhere, a nasty house, fairly standard horror-flick components, but nicely put together in a superficial and derivative mix that somehow is not only fairly entertaining but not entirely without artistic merit. most of the attraction is maybe from the japanese style episodic nature of the story telling, the judicious but unashamed special effects, and the equally japanese tradition that says you dont have to explain all the details of the story. i must admit i did i am told fall asleep at least once, but i honestly don't think i missed too much. like about half the rest of the people there, i was practicing the spectre-like a-a-a-a-a-a at the back-of-the-throat-sound on the way out. this is the kind of silly horror film you jump in, have nightmares about, giggle stupidly when recounting it to your friends, and generally enjoy before having fun slagging it off."", ""more than just a bit confusing, to say the least. jumping between couples and time also adds to the confusion. the film plays like a bunch of random ideas thrown into a blender and mixed together. the child character is oh-so-cliched, as are the 'stalking' images on the victim's photographs. during the climax the heroin is so passive, its as if she simply allows everything to happen without any resistance whatsoever. yawn."", ""i live in switzerland and travel to austria to see a movie in english language once a week. its a fun thing to do because the film is always a 'sneak' not yet on release film in austria. its also a surprise movie, so no-one knows what they are going to get till the curtain goes up. this is fine because it forces me to watch films i would never usually see out of choice. as always, the 'sneak' was well attended with a starting audience of about 150. i was a bit doubt full about the film from the kick off, i mean, a lot of japanese names on the opening credits and some non japanese actors i never heard of... but i figured lets hang in and see what happens... ten minutes into the movie, after a great deal of audience laughter the exodus started... twos and threes to start with then a steady flow with me almost wondering if there might be a fire back there when they found the jawbone in the roof space. as the final credits rolled a glanced over my shoulder i like to sit in the front and to my amazement saw that there were just 3 of us left! thats right.. 3! i mean the move was bad... very bad.. but never in 40 years of regular movie going had i experienced anything like this. i found the effects passable at best, the direction a joke, the acting wooden and the script writer should do the honourable thing and fall on his sword... by the way.. if you saw the movie... don't you think the monster with the long lack hair and white skin looked familiar? awooooooo!"", ""this movie may seem scary on commercials, but the actual movie was a reason to vomit. this is a below below average, even lower than that and has no plot. i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you, but so what? make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead japanese woman. can you say horrible rip-off of samara the ring? don't get me started with the dead child. not even that scary! so what? he has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal! just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge! 110! yuck! .""]",Nicolas Pesce,Andrea Riseborough,Demián Bichir,John Cho,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxODg1Nzc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM0MjEzMw@@._V1_.jpg,"An American nurse living and working in Tokyo is exposed to a mysterious supernatural curse, one that locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming their life and spreading to another victim."

better than anything else i have seen for a considerable time.', ""guy ritchie's the gentlemen plays like a tall tale, filled with exaggerations and embellishments, where the storyteller expects you to pay his bar tab at the end. the narrator is a conniving private detective named fletcher hugh grant, who sets out to blackmail everyone with a screenplay he's written. the screenplay is called bush, bush being a euphemism for marijuana and is a complicated tale about the turf war in the marijuana business. the bush double entendre is also present, just for the chuckles factor. mickey pearson matthew mcconaughey is an american who sees an opportunity in the languishing english aristocracy. he is married to roz michelle dockery, a cockney cleopatra who runs an auto body shop with only women mechanics. mickey loves his wife and is ready to retire from the weed business. two rivals emerge as potential buyers an american jewish billionaire and a chinese-cockney gangster named dry eye. colin farrell's coach is an irish guy who runs a boxing club. mickey's right-hand man is ray charlie hunnan, a mild-mannered man who looks like a desk clerk until you see him in action. the gentlemen of the title is clearly meant sarcastically. hugh grant gives an extraordinary performance in the gentlemen. the script, which ritchie co-wrote with ivan atkinson and marn davies, plays around with genre tropes, but the overriding structure is fletcher pitching his script to an increasingly horrified ray. this pitch goes on for the entirety of the film, and so as scenes unfold, it is as though the scenes emanate from fletcher's imagination, when in reality we are seeing what really happened. guy ritchie's latest gangster comedy presents itself as a harmless romp, but behind its wink-wink-nudge-nudge humour is a bitter and dated worldview. mickey pearson matthew mcconaughey is an american interloper and marijuana dealer who wants out of the game. he hopes to liquidate his weed-farm empire, and interested buyers include jewish-american billionaire matthew berger jeremy strong and chinese mobster dry eye crazy rich asians' henry golding. we learn of mickey's plans and their inevitable unravelling through a screenplay written by sleazy private investigator and aspiring screenwriter fletcher hugh grant. the screenplay is, of course, blackmail, with which fletcher hopes to exploit mickey. ritchie's signature sweary patter is enjoyable, except for the racism, which is especially pointed given the racial delineation of the film's heroes and villains. fletcher is a parasite, one of those tabloid writers who loves to be in on things, and sees people and their reputations as disposable. the entire script is a script within a script, and this is its ace in the hole there is always one layer between us and the characters. hugh grant has become a formidable character actor in the last couple of years, taking full advantage of his options. the one-two punch of paddington 2 and a very english scandal is a perfect example of this, as grant is using all of these other acting muscles he normally hadn't been asked to use, and he's thrilling in a role which is mostly exposition. there's one moment where he puts his hand on hunnam's knee, realizes it's an unwelcome touch, and goes into this wild pop-eyed, oopsie sorrynotsorry facial expression. it's his favorite kind of humor, character-based, behavior-based, and he acts as his own gravitational force. mickey pearson may be the lead, but it's fletcher who gets the last word."", 'read a few reviews that claimed this could be a potential cult classic. this is very far from the truth. definitely a unique film but no way a 8.110 imdb worthy. some of these scores are ridiculous. some people give everything a 8 or 9. i loved how the story was told through the lens of a potential movie script, but at times it was confusing what was going on due to poor character presentation. i will check out other guy ritchie films but in my opinion this is no way close to a cult classic. just my opinion however.']",Guy Ritchie,Matthew McConaughey,Charlie Hunnam,Henry Golding,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2ZjQ4ZGMtZjFhMi00NmI5LTliNjEtODczMWMxNjliZjgxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"An American expat tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him."

downhill,Drama Adventure,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017825/,"[""as a huge hitchcock fan, downhill was an interesting film but while not among his weakest it is a long way from being among his best. the acting is not bad at all, in fact decentlikewise with the chemistry between them, ivor novello's performance is expressive and moving if not always subtle, isabel jeans is a sympathetic julia and annette benson makes mabel's scheming believable. ian hunter is also very naturalistic in his role. the production values and hitchcock's direction are downhill's best qualities, both are superb. the film is really beautifully shot, some of the best and most ahead-of-its-time photography of any of hitchcock's silent films. the choice of locations are appropriate and well-utilised, particularly with the scenes set in the nightclub and theatre. the hand-held camera shots signifying roddy's delirium, the slow pan shot during the dance in the parisian hall scene and the long pulling-back shot with us thinking that roddy is dressing for a fancy night, then us thinking that he is waiter and then we realise that he is on the stage stand out as being especially good technically. hitchcock wasn't yet in his comfort zone, but his direction not only shows technical skill but also early in his career being able to show the psychological insight that he was often so good at. as well as enhancing the mood. from a narrative standpoint unfortunately downhill falls far short in comparison, for all how strong his visuals and direction are hitchcock apparently had little interest in the story and it comes through loud and clear. the story creaks that wooden floorboards in a deserted house, makes very little sense and does drag quite badly at times. the characters are not very interesting and often one-sided which, especially with the female characters, may leave a sour taste in the mouth. the script touches on the social hypocrisy and the separation of classes- morally mostly- but to me it does very little with those themes and while interesting for when and where downhill was set it doesn't hold up well today. on the whole, a mixed view here, loved it technically, didn't care for it narratively. 510 bethany cox"", ""silent film directed by alfred hitchcock about a wealthy young man named roddy ivor novello who takes the blame for a friend's indiscretions with a tramp and finds his whole life unraveling because of it. not entirely successful, with a yawner of an ending, but worth a look for novello's performance and glimpses of hitchcock's emerging style. tenth-billed ian hunter plays a small role as an actor who helps rip roddy off. the whole thing is filmed in sepia tone except for a section in green, the reason behind which is actually fairly clever. watch and i'm sure you'll figure it out. it's a decent picture but it goes on too long. lost my interest well before the disappointing ending. still, give it a go and form your own opinion.

saw the lodger recently and was impressed with his performance, read a biography or two, enjoyed jeremy northam's portrayal in gosford park, and am hunting for other performances in the cinema. this movie is very well done and adds an interesting insight into hitchcock's early career. the quality of the acting, photography, use of symbolism are undeniable. i thought the impression that women are

a dog's reactions should be that of a dog, not a human. about half of the names in the cast are in blink and you'll miss it cameos, and the film only really comes to life when the focus narrows down to ford and buck, getting in touch with nature. it's only the last half hour or so, with them, that keeps me from giving this an even lower score."", ""the 'professional' movie critics have seen too many movies they forget the magic of them. i didn't have any expectations like the folks i mentioned, yet i surprisingly and not surprisingly love it. yes the characters are cliché. but who cares. it provides for good entertainment that kids, especially, will love. i mean who doesn't love a huge smart and caring dog. the dogs are so realistic that i couldn't find any cgi flaw. their expressions were far better than the acclaimed lion king last rendition. i have 2 dogs, a small and a big one. i can tell you that the dogs expressions and reactions are spot on without being out of touch like the lion king. for once they don't talk. although at some point i could easily imagine complete dialogs. ford's charismatic presence made up for the rest of the movie. i came out of the movie light hearted and happy, unlike after a macdonald meal that makes you wonder what you just ate."", ""the call of the wild is a solid, incredibly well made movie. buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. the cgi used to bring him to life is amazing. while it doesn't always look natural, buck's cgi model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. harrison ford also does well as the elderly, depressed john thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. the movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. it's a true joy to look at. however, there are a few problems with the movie. for starters, john thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. another issue is dan stevens' character hal. hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. his presence also completely derails john thornton's resolution. however, despite these problems, i still recommend the call of the wild. it's a fantastic movie, with an incredible protagonist and stunningly beautiful visuals that you shouldn't miss."", ""the call of the wild is a familiar but heartwarming adventure that's surprisingly funny and emotional. the cg dog is great and conveys lots of emotions and the cg in general is also great, though it has moments where it dips in quality. harrison ford is amazing and omar sy gives a really good supporting performance. chris sanders' direction is great and there are some thrilling set pieces. it's well filmed, well paced and the music by john powell is fantastic."", 'i am not sure how the story in the book goes, but the movie was great! it had adventure, beautiful scenery, laughter, and sadness. the entire film flowed well, it had intensity and kept your thoughts wanting to discover what happened next.', ""if you like harrison ford, or dogs, or animals, or nature, or great feel-good stories, or all of the above, you will enjoy this movie. i can't really think of anything bad about it. i enjoyed every minute of it."", ""i was actually very impressed with the cgi dog, who became more and more real as the film went on, probably because of how emotionally involved you become with his character.\nharrison ford is great though in the film for probably 50 of the time.\nanyway, it's all about the story of buck the dog and it's a sweet, lovely, story with an old school feel. the cgi expressions on buck's face are just slightly hyper-real, as in a bit overly emotive compared to a dog in reality, but it works, and if you like dogs, then you'll love buck and his adventures in this movie. he gets treated quite harshly and violently at times, but that makes his story all the more emotional at the end.\ngreat for kids aged 7 and up and great for parents who like an old school movie or fans of harrison ford too!"", 'and thank goodness for that. the novel is beautifully written and also heartbreaking. the movie pulls at the heart strings enough to be effective without ripping said heart apart.\ni watched this in an avxdbox theatre. lots of kids and laughs in the theatre. go and see it.', ""the use of cgi is complete laziness, by studios. i was distracted the entire time, by lack of realism. what happened to old fashioned film making?

emma,Comedy Drama Romance TV Movie,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118308/,"[""this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow although i liked that one, too. it isn't so much that beckinsale is better -- they are both very good -- but that the screenplay is better. davies is a master at adapting austen for filming, and the production values here are very good. it's not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment, but it's close, and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better."", 'while i adore jeremy northam in the winslow boy, mark strong is outstanding as mr. knightley in this much more human version of emma.  she is, as jane austen rightly stated, not our favourite character, and in the gwyneth paltrow version she is even more vain and manipulative.  in this version, kate b makes her very young and yet willing to learn.  i liked it very much and hope the two main characters get picked up very quickly for more movies so that we in canada can see them more often.', 'kate beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming emma in this tv-adaptation of jane austens novel. when i read that novel i was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story for honestly, she is so terribly self-righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously. kate beckinsales interpretation, however, saves emma from herself so to speak she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and one cant help but give in and like not to say love her in spite of her less amiable qualities. kate beckinsale is the main, but not the only, reason why this tv-series is so delightful raymond coulthard is perfect as mr. frank churchill, expressing this characters personal magnetism to the full which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by ewan mcgregor in the 1996-screen adaptation of emma, and mark strong, samantha morton, bernard hepton, and olivia williams are all as they should be in their respective roles. this production is, in short, a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure.', ""of the spate of austen films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more even than persuasion, which was the one that converted me to austeniana. before seeing this emma i had seen two previous versions, but in one emma seemed all wrong, more like lady teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed just right, young and silly and stubborn. in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well indeed it is one of the sweetest, merriest things i have ever seen, rather in the nature of a christmas treat. the script is unusually well formed, and the adapter's additions, like the shaft of light that reveals harriet to emma in church, are all in keeping. mark strong as knightley is not what i would have expected, but i enjoyed him very much he strongly brings out the plain-spoken, practical side of the character, in contrast with emma's affectations, and his choleric outbursts against frank churchill are quite funny. bernard hepton makes mr. woodhouse a figure of almost carrollian absurdity samantha morton as emma's protégé is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be. and as in the same producers' pride and prejudice, care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed--uniquely in some cases. for me this production was and remains a delight."", ""this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel. although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice, emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen's novel -- especially considering its short length. the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one, as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma's character in the rest of the book. i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well-picked. kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow's '96 version. samantha morton's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book. mister knightly's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much-neglected, sumptuous film."", ""jane austen's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen. kake beckinsale's emma is irreproachable. gwyneth paltrow, with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively, she fails to make emma likeable. paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part and i believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses. kate beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly the most romantic of jane austen's heroes actually sees in her. mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks, an appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentlemanly behaviour. emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful."", ""how anyone can prefer the gwyneth paltrow version over this one beats me. kate beckinsale is absolutely charming and doesn't have paltrow's nasal whine, mark strong is possibly not quite as handsome as jeremy northam but he is so endearing! and who was that who said he looked 50? as far as i know, he was actually too young at the time to play mr knightley.harriet, too, is more convincing -- toni colette is far too statuesque. it's much closer to the book than the other version, and elegant as the paltrow film is hmm, isn't that what emma called jane fairfax if she was pressed?, it is also rather cold and distant, whereas this version is warm and gentle. my only quibble with this version is the altogether too friendly ending i doubt whether in jane austen's class-conscious world harriet and her mr martin would ever have danced with the two upper-class couples. nevertheless, whenever i'm in the mood for emma, this is the one i grab!"", ""i believe that this adaptation deserves a much lower grading than the hollywood adaptation with gywneth paltrow, since it doesn't manage to portray any of the austen's subtle wit and humour, and it does not bring onto screen any likable characters. k. beckinsale's emma is a spoiled, self-righteous girl, without the softness or humour of g. paltrow's emma. m. strong's knightley is a harsh brooding person, without the wit or gentleness of northam's knightley. the atmosphere is also rather gloomy the scenes filmed in the dark, the thieves episode, the more obvious presence of servants in the story. the script might be closer to the book regarding the details, but it is certainly far from the luminous and satiric spirit of austen. everybody seems to take himher-self much more seriously here, and emma seems never to realize that she is prone to mistakes as any other human being she preserves that self-righteous feeling until the end of the movie."", ""it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store, only the other version but i fell in love with it. i was always borderline with the other emma. gwenneth and toni collette, as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent, and well to me it doesn't seem natural. it seems put on. sorry but don't think toni and gwenneth did a brilliant job there. i could not warm to any of the characters, but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be. it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on. i was disappointed that mr knightley was not better looking, but he is convincing. i also like jane fairfax better played by olivia williams. i never warmed to her in the movie version, but she is better portrayed in this version. come to think of it, besides mr knightley all characters are better played, and a lot less over the top. unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more publicity. pity...... i also love the new scene at the end. well done to kate beckingsale! therefore, if you are a jane austen fan, don't forget to watch this one."", ""having been a fan of jane austen and of emma since gcses, i was eager overtime to see as many adaptations as possible. aside from the loose, contemporary spin of the story in clueless, a fun film full of energy, i've seen four versions. my least favourite is the gwyneth paltrow film, though i still like it very much for the beautiful cinematography and witty screenplay. i also love the 1972 and 2009 mini-series, the 1972 series had the best frank churchill and 2009 the best mr woodhouse, but after re-visiting it after years of just having fond memories of it i consider this 1996 tv film the best version. it is beautifully photographed, with some of the loveliest costumes and scenery of any period adaptation i've seen recently. and i loved the emphasis on the classes after seeing adaptations like 2007's mansfield park where they don't get enough attention, and didn't actually find it too heavy-handed. the music is effective in how simple in melody and orchestration it, the story is charming and evenly-paced and the writing is controlled and has wit and charm throughout. kate beckinsale looks absolutely radiant as emma, just as much as she did in 1993's much ado about nothing, it helps that she's young and she leaves room for her character emma, a flawed and multifaceted character, to grow. mark strong is a perfect knightley, not as dashing as jeremy northam or jonny lee miller, but still gentlemanly, handsome and compassionate. bernard hepton is perfect as the funny if tiring mr woodhouse, samantha morton is a firm harriet and raymond coulthart is very magnetic as frank churchill. olivia williams, prunella scales, samantha bond and lucy robinson are also excellent. all in all, my favourite emma, i agree the ending is a little too friendly, but other than that this is great. 910 bethany cox""]",Autumn de Wilde,Anya Taylor-Joy,Johnny

the many issues i have with this film. the portrayal of the mental health issues in movie are not bad however i feel that the story deserved more of an indie feel and less of a mainstream hollywood glow. this movie fails to set itself apart from other netflix originals, whereas the book was 1 in a million. finch's family is not supposed to be well off at all, however their house shows different. typical of netflix. he also, at least for me was not what i pictured. he has the same charm and looks wise he fits but the overall feel is a bit off in my opinion. many of the details that made this book so amazing were cut out and left behind which is one of the reasons it becomes almost cheesy. i wish this movie had gone through a bit more screening and thought because the book deserved to make

first cow,Drama Western,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9231040/,"[""the film's visual style is impressive but it's story and pacing is what really drags this film down for me. the cinematography is the one aspect i found to be excellent. the framing is on point and impressive and it adds a lot to the film's style. the production design and costumes are also really good here too. these characters look and feel as if they in the 1820s. the performances are also great too. each character feels believable and works to help tell the story of the film. although i like all that, the pacing is not very good. it feels incredibly long and tedious without any real majorly satisfying payoff. it's a 2 hour movie that feels like it goes on for 2 and a half hours. if they had cut down some of the scenes, this issue wouldn't be as major as it is. there were some elements of the story i enjoyed and some i found to be pointless. if you like a24 then check it out but don't have your hopes incredibly high for it."", ""for those viewers who believe the pace of the film is slow, yes, there are no car chases. instead, this film has a depth of character and original development that creates

real treat."", ""i see lot of people complain about the pacing of the movie. i personally have no problem watching a slow paced movie, in fact i love slow paced movie and most movies that came from a24. my issue with this film is that i don't find any strong emotional connection to the characters. i think mainly because the story is focusing more of the theme of greediness rather than desperation for life. by the time the movie ended, i couldn't find any strong reasons to be empathetic to the characters. i think the movie could be more appealing to larger range of audience if the characters are well developed and more engaging. the movie is still watchable for me, it isn't bad. i love the aesthetic of it. but it could be more engaging."", ""kelly reichardt's old joywendy  lucy

it goes and shows a very detailed introduction of its two protagonists. but detail is the key word for this newest feature by kelly reichardt. the visuals are extremely detailed and so are the characters in general. we get a lot of information just by watching them in their daily lives and slowly the plot thickens and has some unexpected turns. kelly reichardt really did a fantastic job telling that story. she proves a fantastic eye for visuality, showing off some fantastic nature shots that really add a lot to the atmosphere of the film. she did everything right with this film, although she might once in a while loses herself a little bit too much in her details. the actors were wisely chosen and the leading roles filled with rather unknown actors who are usually in secondary roles. first of all there is john magaro who is very subtle and effective. the better performance came from orion lee who is extremely charismatic and does a lot with the role given to him. i think he might have a very interesting future. i loved how he handled that role and gave it many different facettes. there is a good supporting performance by toby jones who does wonders with his rather one dimensional character. ewen bremner is a bit wasted, but not as much as lily gladstone which was insulting. gladstone was brilliant in reichardt's previous film, and ended up in my top 5 supporting actresses so i was shocked how misused she was in this film. but thats just one of the very few flaws the film that. another very positive note goes to the score, which is fantastic and as mentioned before the cinematography. give it a try and try to read as less as possible about it so you have the chance to perfectly soak into it."", ""very sincere effort, deserving sincere review. meticulous re-construction of northern frontier life in the 19th century. we know the californian gold rush dragged countless souls to nw ex-mexico, but before that was the rush for fur. this film captures that silas marner moment, where beaver-felt in europe was on the wane, in favor of silk. you really need some of the frontier on the inside to appreciate how well done  intricate are the details here. a man on foot is far less effective than one on horseback, making our two fellow-pioneers poor though you'd expect the squire, at least to own a horse? and i've never met an oriental man who can't cook better than any westerner - a fact of life that's hard to ignore. as for the pace of this artistic film, if you complain about that it's slightly missing the point. you see a lot of this in the work of the french cinematic school, mid 20th century, long scenes with minimalist dialogue perfectly spoken  punctilious for the tiniest of details - something hollywood ought to consider as an alternative to effects for fxs-sake, big-star egos, oppressive self-censorship and disarmingly gratuitous violence. i liked first cow, not only for its cinematic endeavor, but also for its a-u-d-a-c-i-t-y to be different in an age of in-your-face predictable-ness. as for the ending, the viewer needs the intelligence to figure this one out without having things spelt-out."", 'this film

granted, the script did no one any favours, but it seemed like a few actors did not even try to make it work. this made it very difficult to stay in the fictional world because the dialogue and the characters felt so disconnected. the main female lead also felt a bit shoe horned in to get the feminism points and it took away character development from some of the other characters. sony needs to throw in the towel with super hero ips and stop dragging good actors down with their box office failures.', ""7.510\nin my opinion, kraven the hunter delivers an entertainingly violent final mission in what potentially marking sony's last attempt at a spider-man villain spin-off, and when you compare the spin off films apart from the venom trilogy, i think kraven the hunter has already surpassed the awful madame web just by the violent itself even if the main story didn't engage most of the audience except me who found it engaging enough to enjoy, added with good addition to the film with both russell crowe and one of the emperor twins in gladiator ii, fred hechinger, the violent was fun, and kraven himself stands out as a compelling antihero, the film is far from a groundbreaking cinematic achievement and its flaws are evident, the overall thrilling hunt is pure entertainment, it serves as a passable, and in my opinion a pretty good conclusion to sony's strange and seemingly confused spider-man universe, of all the characters introduced, tom hardy's venom and aaron taylor-johnson's kraven are the two i'd most like to see return, perhaps in a future mcu."", ""most movies fail to deliver after reshoots and delays but kraven the hunter is an exception. the rated action scenes are thrilling!

unusual behaviour--anyone with a bit of sense would make it abundantly clear that bardem was suffering from dementia, so that others would then treat him more sensitively.\nthe third error concerns the daughter repeatedly excusing herself from an important meeting at her work which involved an important project she had undertaken. it seems that because she didn't make it into work that day, someone else or their work was chosen above hers. at no point does she explain the truth about why she couldn't get into work ie that she was having to deal with her very ill father instead she gave mumbled, ineffectual excuses which most likely sounded very lame to her boss or whoever was calling her from her work. why the hell wouldn't she convey the gravity of her situation when she might then

valley girl,Comedy Romance,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/,"[""it was 1983 and i was 13. i watched valley girl on hbo one night when my parents were working. after it ended i wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. we woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. we began to worship the main character, julie, played by the beautiful deborah foreman. i am not saying this is a great classic. although it is for me personally. and i understand that the whole valley girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's. but deep down at the heart of the movie-it is a love story, and a familiar but good one. girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. julie's friends don't like him-he doesn't fit in, doesn't go to their school, doesn't have money. they like her better with her ex-boyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk. she makes the ultimate sacrifice-her own happiness for her friends' happiness. and she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. it is one of nicholas cage's first movies and his first starring role. one minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic. his friend fred is pretty funny too. if you were a teenager in the 80's you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories. it is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. i am eagerly awaiting it's release on dvd if they ever release it. you can go to deborah foreman's website to sign a petition to get it released on dvd and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music."", ""i'm glad cage changed his name from coppolla and got this part on his own. light-hearted, no deep thought needed, but a cute piece about opposites attracting- though her parents are still hippies.... captures the voice of the early 80's- the whine of the valley and the funk of the other side.  one can see the beginning of cage's talent."", ""the first time i saw valley girl, i was bedridden and as sick as a dog, out of junior high school for two weeks with a nasty illness.  i watched it on a tiny black and white set with the volume turned down to a whisper so my parents wouldn't hear and make me shut it off.  i was mesmerized.  it was a revelation.  martha coolidge's milking of the romeo and juliet premise with nicolas cage and deborah foreman filling in as star-crossed lovers in the san fernando valley was smart and convincing.  i was amazed by the hot val chicks.  i was thrilled by the interesting vocabulary words.  i wanted to be like cage's tough randy and fall in love with a beautiful girl like foreman's julie to the sounds of eddie grant, modern english, and the plimsouls."", ""young, teenage angst. when valley girl julie deborah foreman meets randy  a very young nic cage from hollywood, they hit it off. but, of course, her friends don't approve. of anything about him his clothes, his hair, his friends. can randy convince julie to follow her heart and not her friends? runs like a john hughes film, although his sixteen candles actually came out a year after this, so maybe he got the idea from valley girl. directed by martha coolidge. the best part of this film is the music featured - the plimsouls, josie cotton, bonnie hayes, sparks. and the first two we actually watch perform as part of the plot. this one is rated r, while sixteen is pg...much more toned down. some fun gags... julie's overly permissive hippie parents. the driver's ed class. cruising the hollywood strip. it's an oldie but a goodie."", ""i've seen this movie quite a few times and each time i watch it, the quirkier and funnier it becomes. perhaps its the lack of research that went into nicolas cage's character's 'punk' persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film...nonetheless it's a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters. i think it's right up there with fast times and weird science quintessential eighties flicks!"", ""i remember reading a review by roger ebert who liked this movie as well as hearing other people who agreed. i think it was dreadful, i knew it was gonna be a high school romance flick, but unlike the successful hughes films like sixteen candles, pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful, or the raunchier ones like porky's and fast times at ridgemont high, valley girl is boring, unfunny and poorly made. there's nothing original about the story or any of the characters, the production wallows in it's own low budget trappings, and man is the acting bad. what a dud. i've seen porn with more entertaining dialogue, how can this movie have entertained anyone."", ""i watched this film after reading the plethora of positive imdb reviews, touting it as romeo and juliette for the eighties and, while it does share with the bard's masterpiece the theme of forbidden teenage love, all similarities begin and end there. filled with pointless story lines, characters on both sides of the divide who are sorely lacking in intellect, depth and purpose, and an ending that is pathetically lazy and neither intriguing nor romantic, this sorry excuse for a film brings absolutely nothing new to the table and fails miserably at even adding anything interesting, let alone insightful, to a familiar, seemingly straightforward topic. for a truly brilliant take on the complications of love among the young, rich and shallow, watch amy heckerling's clueless, itself based much more faithfully on another work of classic literature, yet adapted to not only appeal to but actually shape the culture of its time. what a shameful insult to william shakespeare it is, having his timeless work of poetic style and substance compared to this vacuous garbage."", ""the 80's were an amazing time in punk culture and yet none of that is shown in the movie. it watered down bs for the masses. there isn't even any actual punk music. it was incredibly disappointing."", ""everyone has a great list of cinematic guilty pleasures, and valley girl has been on mine from the first time i saw it.  it was clear from the first valley view of the san fernando that it was several cuts above your average teen-aimed movie.  obviously, nicolas cage was pretty impressive, even if i had no idea of his heritage or his future.  i liked deborah foreman, too, and the supporting cast was well-chosen.  if the plot was trifling, it was at least clever and certainly not pretentious. and the music, from the opening by foremen and her friends to the closing shot of the limo ride to modern english's i melt with you, is a big plus. overall, an very entertaining take on love across the valley of cultural differences from martha coolidge, who is one of our most underrated directors."", ""there were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right this was one of them. cage is hillarious, so is forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the hollywood limelight. i'd love to see this released on dvd with in a special version with commentaries by cage and forman. wishful thinking, i know. ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, sure thing and 16 candles and breakfast club. it will take you back to a totally rad time which it seemed at the time, was a lot more simple. memo to studios time to release the dvd!"", ""valley girl will always hold a special place in my heart  i would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen-sex-comedies, but that is a back-handed compliment.  this is a good movie, period.  it is very specific in time and place--nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot--yet its story remains timeless.  this is just romeo and juliet, minus the death, after all!  nicolas cage is wonderful, showing all the early promise that, it turns out, he has squandered on overblown action crapola.  deborah foreman is the revelation of this movie, and i can't believe she didn't go on to have a bigger career someone rediscover her quick.  this is sweeter and gentler than most films of the genre--the requisite nudity seems thrown in by contractual obligation--and, while not groundbreaking, it certainly is nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and doesn't crucify its shallow young girls for having fun--even foreman's crew of best friends, misguided by peer pressure, are never presented as villains.  indeed, her friend stacy, forced to doubledate w cage's friend fred, has a good time despite her protests, and makes out w fred in the backseat.  this will take you back to the early 80's if you were there, but it holds up quite well today.  warning to those unfamiliar with the movie  do not watch one of vh1's seemingly continual showings of it--go rent it in its unedited glory.  otherwise, you are missing some of the movies' most potent, time-specific dialogue.  and one can't write about valley girl and not mention the fabu soundtrack of great 80's tunes--most of them by one-hit wonders, which are not only integral to the sense of time and place in this movie, but thematically well-chosen. see it--awesome little flick!  fer shur!!"", ""for starters, nochols cage proves that he can not only act but carry a film. valley girl is still known to many as the film that made nicholas cage an actor. although it helps being related to francis ford coppola, it also helps if you can act. cage proves himself in this blast from the past movie about growing up in the valley during the awesome 80's. a good soundtrack if this is your kind of thing, the wardrobe and the attitude is true 80's. at moments, you want to laugh at some of the clothes that the teens are dressed in. although cage is great as a high school kid from hollywood, deborah foreman looks more like a woman in her late 20's than someone in high school. looking back, the valley girls have all moved to malibu or the glendale area, the valley today is what downtown hollywood was back in 1983. still, a fun movie to watch and to recall how things use to be before the 1990's.""]",Rachel Lee Goldenberg,Jessica Rothe,Josh Whitehouse,Mae Whitman,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NzI5OTgyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNjU1MDE@._V1_.jpg,"Julie, a

our whole family loved it.', ""not a bad movie but i don't know why you would choose to make a scooby-doo movie and not include matthew lilard, grey delisel and frank welker. it's just a marketing ploy using bigger names and sacrificing quality for money. still worth watching but could have been a lot better."", ""scooby-doo is one property that has probably done just about everything you can think of for a franchise that has gone on for a few decades, i'm not going to even bother listing all the things this intellectual property has had its hand, er, paw in because we could be here all day or all night depending on when you're reading this.... the news of a big screen reboot just made me go meh! at it, on account that this franchise is still going and it seems like they release a new direct-to-video feature or tv series every week at least, but i guess you could do worse since scooby-doo these days is mostly stale but not offensive. i didn't mind the look of the characters, you could have done worse in design. i didn't mind the change of voice actors all that much and i like the idea of a hanna-barbera cinematic universe because why not? it's been done before on the small screen and comic strip books. i didn't see it in theatres obviously, i don't need to go into the specifics as to why, if circumstances had been different i probably would have seen it in the theater and i didn't want to spend more than 20 to rent it, so i waited till it came on hbo max to see it. overall i would say it's 4060, 40 percent being good and 60 percent being meh to dire. there are some nice ideas, good voice acting, and funny moments throughout, but the plot isn't particularly well thought out and, as my summary states, it's less of a scooby-doo picture and more of a blue falcon movie, so much so that i was left to ask myself on repeat why didn't you just make a blue falcon movie, warner bros.? blue falcon isn't as well-known a property as scooby-doo, so you can have more free reign to do with that in crafting a narrative and potentially gaining a new audience in the process - worked for marvel with iron man, thor, guardians of the galaxy, and many others. will the family like it? i think they will, it has problems but it's not what i would call boring either, wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, just tone down the world building and, i don't know, have some mystery to the plot, because last i checked scooby-doo is about mystery incorporated."", ""scoob, the first entry in the hanna-barbera cinematic universe is out and it's scooby dooby great! the animation in this movie is beautiful. the style of the animation looks modern with vibrant colors and stunning settings and my favorite, mystery machine. i think the animation is best on the mystery machine because it makes the mystery machine look beautiful. the feel of the movie is very upbeat and fun. the beginning of scoob! stayed true to the original premise but the ending did not stay as true to the original because they fight the real supernatural not a human pretending to be a monster. the casting of this movie is excellent, jason issacs did a great dick dastardly, and ken jeong is amazing as dynomutt and his dialogue is amazing. it was fun seeing him do a serious character for a change. one of my favorite scenes in the movie is at the beginning on halloween when they solve their first mystery after meeting each other and my second favorite scene in the movie is at the end when they fight cerberus. the theme of this movie is friendship, an important thing right now because it is something everyone needs to get through these trying times. throughout the movie, we see other characters from the hanna-barbera cinematic universe like dick dastardly and muttley, captain caveman, and during the end credits, we see atom ant, the great grape ape, jabberjaw, dr. frankenstein, and dr. benton quest who we see is currently developing r.o.s.i.e. if you like movies like big hero 6 then you will like scoob!

is a cute and safe movie, but it could've been so much more, if you're a huge fan of the character, absolutely watch it! i would just lower your expectations as this is aiming for much younger audiences and that's really all it wants to be. i will also say i'm totally on board with getting more hanna barbera movies in this style, just crack that story down and i'm sold!

shirley,History Drama,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14077516/,"['i am so proud to be the 1st to review this remarkable film. the directing was precise. the storyline was factual and poignant. the sets and props were on point. the wardrobe was accurate. the lighting was ephemeral. the dedication was heartfelt. the acting....well the actors, these artisans were authentic, sincere and of the highest echelon of portraying actual people. but all and all, regina king gave the performance of her life - thus far. thank you, ms. king! this is a must-see movie!! it needs to be seen by everyone who cares anything about fixing our broken democracy. oh, shirley chisholm, how we need you now!', ""this shirley is possibly even more bold than shirley, the waitress cooking up burgers for rerun, from what's happening! this is a great piece of american culture as it is about the first black congresswoman, shirley chisholm, who became the first black woman to run for president of the united states. she was portrayed as a smart and savvy person who wouldn't let people tell her no or that she couldn't or shouldn't do something she believed in. the story follows her as she ramps up her presidential run, the people in her inner circle, her husband's role and of course the obstacles she had to overcome. overall, the storytelling lacked finesse and subtly as it was a bit heavy-handed at times and felt like a choppy bullet list of moments. the acting and costumes felt spot on. cool political and inspirational story."", ""congresswoman shirley chisholm regina king, the first african-american woman elected to the house of representatives, was an inspiring, trailblazing politician, particularly in the areas of race and gender politics. after winning her seat in congress in 1968, she later went on to run for the democratic party nomination for president in 1972. and that impressive background, one would think, should provide the basis for an engaging, uplifting film biography. unfortunately, writer-director john ridley's take on this groundbreaking, often-unappreciated pioneer misses the mark in a number of ways. the biggest problem is a script that tries to cover too much ground in its 15800 runtime, addressing an array of elements from chisholm's personal and political life and not covering either area particularly well, most notably in the film's first half before settling down in the picture's back end. the narrative jumps around so much that the picture becomes choppy and unfocused - almost incoherent at times - primarily due to some inexplicably mystifying film editing and a lack of sufficient explanation and back story, especially for those who may not know much about the protagonist's life going in. the film also features some rather questionable casting choices, such as the selection of actor w. earl brown to portray alabama governor george wallace, who neither looks nor sounds anything like the conservative southern democrat who also ran for president in 1972 and was subsequently shot during the campaign. even king's performance is somewhat uncharacteristically lacking as she struggles mightily to definitively capture chisholm's singular demeanor and vocal inflections, qualities that sometimes don't always resonate, despite the actress's strong physical resemblance to her character. the real standout here is lance reddick, who gives one of his career's best portrayals as chisholm's political mentor in one of his last screen performances. it's disappointing that this inspirational social and political leader hasn't received the worthy cinematic tribute she truly deserves. perhaps shirley might have worked better as a miniseries than as a standalone vehicle, as that format likely would have provided a better option for more fully telling her story in all of the detail it seeks to depict here. indeed, for someone who endeavored to rise up to the challenges she faced, it's disheartening that the film seeking to depict that effort doesn't match what she so earnestly sought to accomplish."", ""basically the same movie you watched thousands of times before if you are a critic, you know the plot, the difficulty the protagonist has to endure and the conversation and scenes, its that type of movie again, its not a good one to be honest, its very mild and forgettable, not even sherly actress it's good enough like in other movies, its not enough, overall this is not a recommendation for me, the colman domingo movie this same year and also in netflix is basically the same but with a guy as the lead, its not a good story and it's not a good movie ok, lets di better ok, lets di better next time ok."", ""i fully intended to find shirley to be inspirational and important. however, less than 20 minutes into the film, i could do nothing but abandon the experience. i know regina king is an excellent actor, but how could she possibly work with such horrendously amateurish writing? every character was a cartoon and every line was utterly painful to hear. every scene felt like a contrived skit meant to teach us an important life lesson, and the combined effect was short of an after-school special. it was a real shame to waste such an historic figure and moment in time on such a terrible script. didn't the producers see this train wreck coming?"", ""a netflix original, currently streaming, about a forgotten, in some circles, black woman who ran for president during the early 1970's. oscar winner regina king plays shirley chisolm who became the first black woman to be elected representative to congress who due to some bureaucracy she didn't get to work on the committees she wanted due to her freshman status was advised to 'go for it'  run for president against nixon even though fellow democratic nominee, george wallace, played w. earl brown, an unapologetic racist, was doing better in the polls. buoyed by the support of her husband, michael cherrie  her advisors which include the late, great lance reddick, oscar nominee terrence howard, brian stokes mitchell  oscar nominee lucas hedges, the race is on or is it as king's presence in the electorate is vague at best which aligned wher efforts to not bother campaigning in areas which she feels are a long shot makes her the slimmest of also ran's but then brown is the victim of an assassination attempt which signals to king a chance may be had wthe film's last third focusing on the eve of the democratic convention where pledges for the possible nominee come to the fore. king is great here don't be surprised if she caps another emmy win come this time next year as even in the most vulnerable moments, her strength is evident further buoyed a stellar supporting cast that writerdirector  oscar winner, john ridley he won for his script for 12 years a slave, gets great mileage from."", ""how is it that i'm just now discovering shirley chisholm? being the first black woman in congress to be nominated for president is a significant achievement. shirley was tenacious and committed to bringing about change that would benefit everyone. she faced a lot of blowback and was nearly attacked, but she continued to speak her mind. many of shirley's campaign crew disagreed with her decisions and were discouraged, but the faithful ones stayed and supported her even after she lost. shirley was willing to risk everything for her campaign, including her life savings, which her husband conrad did not agree with. he believed she needed to be practical and give up while she was ahead. i was furious that rob dellums, shirley's long-time advisor and friend, went behind her back and betrayed her, but she chose to forgive him. i learned that she didn't blame him for his choice because not everyone has the courage to stand up for what's right instead, they would rather give in to public perception in order to obtain a small amount of power.""]",Josephine Decker,Elisabeth Moss,Michael Stuhlbarg,Odessa Young,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFjMTk2NjctNzgxYy00MjA3LThiYTUtZDA1NTI1OTA3NDUzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Shirley Chisholm makes a trailblazing run for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination after becoming the first Black woman elected to Congress.

themes in this very preachy but often action-packed movie about vietnam war vets trying to reconcile their pasts and improve their lots in life. but there's like three-movies-in-one here and spike lee seems to have fired the editor who should have removed 30 minutes of drag from this often dramatic effort. interesting but overly long, sentimental in bizarre places, preachy nearly beyond redemption."", ""i really wanted to like this movie, but the writing was all over the place and the pace was so boring. this is not a classic war movie, it's just a bunch of guys complaining how they got treated badly by the man. just boring."", ""a spike lee joint. those familiar with his work will recognize his trademark style mixed with homage from some of the most brilliant war films of all time. thats not to say spike lee rips anyone off, but instead incorporates themes and elements from some all time classics no need to list references here. the film is incredibly relevant in these times, and can be a difficult watch, but a necessary one. spike's film can seem disjointed at times but in an incredibly artistic way. not everyone will appreciate this. i could go on and on about the brilliant oscar worthy performances of the actors, but let's be honest, you're either gonna watch this or not. watch this."", 'looks like spike got lazy and called this one in. daughter conceived 50 years ago looks like a 25 year old, the mother looks 40, not 65. gold got washed away in a mudslide but went uphill? plot mimics treasure of sierra madre, gold drives men to insanity due to selfishness. hard to follow the flashbacks because the younger men looked like the older men. would have been a 10 if final editing was not a rush job.', ""... and if you're looking for vietnam war action, don't watch. but if you want a movie about friendship, ptsd, racial tension, usa's dubious role in history? watch."", 'this movie could have been 90 minutes. but it is overlong, due to the fact that spike lee fills up the movie with documentary style cuts, focusing on racism in america. but it just feels so out of touch with the overall arc of the story, which is actually very promising. i dont think that the racism-stuff should have left behind, but i think it would have worked a lot better, if they just toned it down a nutch, without jumping around. with that said, the second half of the movie is very good. delroy lindo is amazing, his scenes alone in the jungle are awesome. the final showdown is also very rewarding. but its just the first half that ruins the movie. more than one hour has passed, before something actually happens. and i think a lot of viewers will turn away in that time. i almost did so myself. 2hours and 45 minutes is crazy given a plot, that is very thin, and filled up with out-of-place stuff, that just contributes to lose the overall focus of the movie.\n610', ""whoa....this was a hell of a ride!\nnow, if you are expecting da 5 bloods to be a movie in the sense of a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, it might not work for you.\ni am not sure myself it worked for me but i didn't feel like i could just ignore it either.\nthis is like a pile of political, emotional and historical statements not necessarily linked in one single bundle. at times it ends up being a tarantino-like mess, but with relevance.\nit is surely timely, it is heavily politically loaded, it is emotional and intense, angered but also ironical and lighthearted at moments.\nmaybe not to be judged, let alone rated, but just to be absorbed."", ""sometimes it has the atmosphere of a comedy movie. the movie has good actings, good edition and photography, but it felt like empty critics without fundament were more important than a good story for the director. the thread had a big potential, but surely the director couldn't reach it."", ""'da 5 bloods 2020' is engaging and alarming. it confronts its audience with some harsh truths and, at times, is an uncomfortable experience because of it. it's also an important experience, though, as it tangles with themes of exploitation, racism, post-traumatic stress and war with a surprising degree of nuance. though the piece is an odd mix of black comedy, traditional action and shocking archive footage, it somehow comes together as a fictional tale that conveys quite a bit of truth. it's effective in almost all its aspects. the thing does feel long but that's principally because it's constantly unpredictable, shifting in tone and, even, genre often within the same scene. its formalistic elements often catch you off guard, too. at times, it's truly horrifying i mean, some of its graphic stock footage is the sort of thing you can never unsee. its frankness is a part of its dna, though. while it isn't necessarily a fun film, it is one worth watching. it offers a new perspective on an often misrepresented time-period. it rings true despite its fictional plot. 810"", ""challenging, thought provoking, and downright chaotic. spike lee's new joint da 5 bloods is a wild one, and he does not hold back any punches here. what starts off as a road tripreunion film about a group of vietnam vets looking for the remains of their old comrade and their treasure, turns into something brutal and raw. it's a war movie, but it's a movie about humanity too. it doesn't just signify the cost of war and the effects it has on the individual, but the hate that's created from it. what i love about lee is his insistence on making the audience a part of the film and not just the observer. when he wants you to see an image he really wants you to see it, and boy are there a lot of haunting images in this film. i think what people have to understand is this isn't just about the black experience of the war, it's the experience of being human and the path we walk. the character of paul is a symbol of someone who chooses to walk the path of hate and how they refuse to stop walking that path. i'm a little bummed that lee decided to make that character a straight up trump supporter as i find that to be less subtle and more likely to trigger people into turning on this movie since that could ignite it into a more politcal conversation. it's like lee gave up some of the subtle tactics to ensure the audience is receiving what he's getting at but i honestly don't think he neeed too, the dialogue and the characters are profound enough to get that message across. showing a maga hat becomes a little too on the nose and i know people are just gonna trash all over this movie for that reason, but hopefully i'm wrong. this isn't lee's best film, but it's a deep and interesting one. i love how he cuts between different aspect ratios and makes the flashback scenes look 16mm it made it feel that much more immersive. i think he could've trimmed down the first half as it's at least 20 minutes too long, but that didn't stop me from really feeling moved by what he did here. it's a hard watch, but it's a necessary watch, and it only adds to the conversation right now of the black experience i can't stress that enough. it's a disturbing, violent, and graphic film, but it needs to be seen. 910."", ""just don't understand why the past actors were also the present actors in the story line, did we not have a budget to cast younger actors to portray the flashbacks? i mean everyone just looked tired and not good at all. why were there so many corny lines cheesy and lame set ups, and why were the monologues so long and pointless. i got the point a million times, i think i'm more

told. and i recommend seeing the movie as if it were a fictionalized documentary, because the counter is as we already know what happens there is neither suspense nor emotion, and beware that i do not say it because it is bad, even the performances are very good, mainly that of the spanish.\ni say this for example, the characters are shown as deserters, worms who escape from cuba to go over to the enemy, that is exactly halfway through the film, only to show them as spies at the service of the revolution to anticipate and avoid attacks on cuban soil. that if it were an invented story would have been an interesting plot twist, but as we already know what they play, it is like that remains in the air and is not surprising, even when they are captured. with a bit of general knowledge on the subject, we know that all of them were apprehended for about 15 years some more others less, so that in the end it is not that there is a tension to see if they are caught or not or if they escape or

that many reviews focus only on the historical accuracy of the movie, which - in my view - is just a secondary, if not tertiary, criterion of judgement.\ni think wasp network is a movie which does not live up to the ambitions it lets transpire i think the main flaw is that the story is rather complicated but not so relevant, original or dramatic. the second flaw is that the director's choices made

always another side. so, the movie is entertaining for sure. every bad one star review here is simply politically biased. it is just people that can't stand cuba's point of view. my advise is that you should watch and judge it by yourself. it's not supposed to be a documentary, but it is an incredible story based on real facts and real people. have fun."", ""i am not sure why anyone would rate this

himself and his own ego that keeps making self-indulgent and boring movies, that are huge failures both financially and artistically. this film did horribly at international film festivals, so there's barely any artistic value in it, except perhaps it's cinematography. the a-list cast deliver mediocre performances, poorly directed, and the accents are all over the place. the movie failed at getting any distribution deals throughout 2019, to finally settle for netflix simply cause no distributor saw any value in a 2hr plus painfully long narrative with no point of view. assayas is so all over the place with the narrative and disorienting chronological jumps that not even the documentary style narrator's voice over can save it. totally out of tone and anticlimactic to hear history channel style voice over in a narrative film.\ndespite its historical inaccuracies, the movie fails to examine the most valuable dramatic conflict of all how a self-discerning man who escapes a tyrannical dictatorship returns to it after experiencing the free world. that character study would be by far more dramatically rewarding that the mere archetypes this film presents. as in many more of his previous films, like carlos, assayas is more interesting in set design, and signage accuracy than emotional accuracy, and the movie falls flat. it's a boring, long, waste of 2hrs.""]",Olivier

relic,Horror Mystery,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9072352/,"[""another quality entry from a 21st century australian filmmaker, it's a film which horror i don't think most young people can experience or recognize properly, because it gets real with age, and, as you grow older, it creeps into you as some sort of inheritance, a legacy where you find yourself thinking of dying not in those romantic terms where you'd decide your own fate, but in terms of personal diminishing and gradual demise as, next in line for it, you slowly but surely creep towards your own death. relic is drama-first, horror-second, yet that doesn't spoil its genre effectiveness. the three women portraying the three generations within the same family are all great and, even more importantly - relatable. with so many movies right now having these perplexingly high metascore marks, relic is the one where i actually think its rating is highly unfair. my bet is it'll age gracefully."", ""i am so tired of horror movies where the characters move to a new house and walk in dark corridors for 80 minutes. what's that sound? oh it's a washing machine. it doesn't matter. what's that sound? oh it's just grandma being a weirdo. go to bed grandma. what's that-- it's all a meaningless barrage of random nonsense. we need the first 80 minutes of the movie to get to the actual reason why this movie was made - the pretentious last 10 minutes. just release that allegory for dementiadepression as a stand alone short film and don't waste my time with filler."", 'a solid debut for natalie james. this is a slow burn horror that builds with each minute, and by the third act is full blown terror. all of the acting was surprisingly phenomenal, extremely impressed by bella heathcote. the third act is a fun ride, claustrophobic and even a little gore. give it a shot, you wont be disappointed.', ""making movies for today's horror audience is a tricky proposition, but relic impressed me with it's commitment to telling an emotional story that resonates with issues which you may recognise from our lives outside of the fantasy-horror tropes. the movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters impressive performances, who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural victoria. if you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a less is more approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. it should be noted though, just the like characters in relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards."", ""this is well done and i can't say i have seen anything like it. the actors are very good and the script is creative and well timed. it's a fairly slow burn but not enough to lose your attention. i love a good horror but this one hit too close to home. i couldn't handle it. that's never happened before.\nwhen i was a teenager, my best friend and i, used to get rocked and go see movies like the exorcist. so, when i say i couldn't handle this movie, that says something.\nif you love a good horror and you are the target audience, this one will give you nightmares. if you're not the target audience, it probably won't phase you. for instance, if you are afraid of flying, then movies about aircraft accidents will effect you. if you are not afraid of flying you can mentally step back and not get nervous watching a movie about airplane accidents. it's like that. if something like this has even remotely touched your life, this movie will rattle your cage big time."", 'you may just watch the last 15 minutes of the film.even those 15 minutes will bore you death.']",Natalie Erika James,Emily Mortimer,Robyn Nevin,Bella Heathcote,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNjYzA3OTItNzQ2NC00OTZjLWJiMzYtNWQ1YWQ5YTc0YjI2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"A daughter, mother and grandmother are haunted by a manifestation of dementia that consumes their family's home."

was a rather pleasant surprise. despite being based on animal cracker cookies of all things, the movie managed to exceed my expectations with its creativity, humor, style, and voice acting. the movie

animal. but that's an extremely paired down synopses because there's also a long standing feud with owen's still living uncle horatio, animosity between owen and his father in law, a subplot involving a dog biscuit flavor like people food, and a few other speed bumps along the way. however, while the story can sometimes feel overcluttered with too many moving parts, it does make up for it with its creativity and economically delivered style. this is not a pixar or dreamworks movie so it's best to set your expectations before hand. with that said, despite this being an independently produced animated film it still looks vibrant with lots of details including a very well staged scene set to queen's don't stop me now that's filled with creative transitions, smooth animation, and vibrant colors. the movies third act falls apart at the end especially since the antagonists does an abrupt turn and changes character from an egotistical jerk to a power mad villain bent on world

dialogue between characters with almost little to zero development. very all around the mill below average animated film. not that bad, but certainly not good.', 'this is for very young children. it has a very colourful palette. the characters are dichotomously good or evil. there is but much for adults, possibly except the star studded voice cast.', 'it is surprising that this movie got made and

no one sticking up for them when they clearly had drug and mental health problems, these people are just hypocrites who like to complain because they are obsessed with a celebrity who doesn't know they exist. just keep this in mind before you choose to watch or not because it is ridiculous to boycott a film like this just because you get offended over a joke that doesn't add or impact the storyline. wish people would think for themselves and not just listen to everything twitter tells them.\nanyway, the film itself is definitely an improvement from the last one, the storyline is more compelling and the acting was definitely better, but somehow is slightly more cringey in many aspects and i think the kissing booth theme is kind of irrelevant for this plot and left messy at the end."", ""have they learned nothing from the first movie??

waiting for the barbarians,Drama History,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6149154/,"[""waiting for the barbarians is a film directed by ciro guerra, and stars mark rylance, johnny depp, and robert pattinson. this is a historical drama where mark rylance plays the magistrate for this fortress on the frontier of the empire. there is no date or location given, and not even a name for the so-called empire. this is because the main theme deals heavily with imperialism, and the mistreatment that has gone on in almost every example of it. johnny depp and robert pattinson are the bad guys checking up on the frontier, and trying to handle the barbarians. now that we have simple routine out of the way, let me describe how i personally thought this movie was.\nthis film has very important themes, and strong performances, but struggles to really keep your attention. the movie starts off pretty strong, with this rivalry between johnny depp who is brilliant in this by the way, and mark rylance. it was highly entertaining to see their ideology duel and it looked like it was going somewhere. however, then we get to the long second act where it basically takes too long at everything. also, there is no johnny depp, or any interesting characters or plot really. mark rylance is good, but his character is just wimpy, and not charismatic. he is just utterly weak in almost every sense. he is also kinda creepy with his weird foot fetish scenes you will know when you see them. it finally picks up in the third half which is carried by robert pattinson and johnny depp. this isn't because mark rylance is bad, but his character on his own is just extremely boring. everytime robert or johnny was on screen, it was very entertaining. i just feel they made mark's character way more interesting. besides seldom clunky moments, the acting is pretty good.\nthe actual story is kinda interesting, but i feel we have seen it done in a more entertaining fashion. don't get me wrong, i'm not saying i wanted more action in this movie, i just felt like more conflict was needed especially in the second act. the themes are very important, and it does a good job of showing it imperialism is bad. the cinematography was okay, it just didn't have a lot of wow moments. the soundtrack also didn't strike me much, but was okay. honestly, if this film didn't have johnny or robert, i don't think i would have liked it nearly as much. in the end it is an okay film, but ultimately suffers from being kinda boring the whole second act. i will say that the johnny depp and robert pattinson performances are worth it in the end. i would recommend renting this movie despite its shortcomings."", ""this film makes the viewers question who are the real barbarians. i find it engaging and introspective. it's beautifully shot too."", ""although the cinematography and the acting are almost excellent the slow pace of the story makes waiting for the barbarians just a movie that is worth watching once but not more. it just lacks some oomph, maybe some battle scenes to make it better. there is some cruelty and torturing though, physical and mental torture, so the story is still captivating and the excellent acting of mark rylance is the best thing of the movie. johnny depp and robert pattinson are for once the bad people, and they did a very good job playing characters that everybody normal will dislike. all in all it isn't a bad movie but it clearly misses something to make it exceptional."", ""caught from the first act of the film by the set ,the mood,the music, the customs ,the lighting the performance of mark rylance and johnny depp paving the way for watching a masterpiece..the structure of the characters revealed and their intentions is obvious leading to an inevitable clash between

despite knowing what that would lead to ..that's where the film begin to have a lot of holes and unclear parts messed with the continuity of the film messing the script structure and a lot of things

hard to stay engaged, and the adaptation lacked the depth and emotional resonance of its source material. while the narrative aimed to be thought-provoking, it felt superficial, failing to capture the novel's subtlety. despite the cast's efforts, the film missed the mark on delivering a compelling exploration of its profound themes."", 'this is one of the movies that you have to see it first and

which does, of course, have an overarching story - a unique feel. it's also an apt way to condense a lifetime into two hours, featuring only the most significant moments of its eponymous character's life. it all seems a little surreal, especially when it begins to visualise its narration in the middle of select scenes. the experience starts off a little slow but it soon picks up the pace, moving towards its low-key finale with a fair bit of momentum. most of it is presented rather farcically, its eccentric characters flailing their arms or speaking in eloquent metaphor. there are a fair few moments that provoke a chuckle or two, but the flick still retains some resonance. it isn't all overtly comedic some of its more sobering stuff does, indeed, sting. it comes so close to having something to say about class, but this aspect remains distinctly subtextual and always comes second to the more straightforward story. this isn't a huge issue, though. perhaps the movie's biggest asset is its ensemble cast. patel, who perfectly portrays the adult version of the whimsical protagonist, is a real stand-out. as are capaldi and laurie, who play eccentric but endearing middle-aged men. each and every cast member is decidedly good, though, doing exactly what they need to with apparent joy. overall, the film is entertaining and well-made. it's fun, energetic and, in general, just a good time. 710"", ""this is a fun and enjoyable movie. the weird comments by people who can't comprehend a non-white cast are baffling. if you can't enjoy a film because of the colour of actor's skin, that's your problem, not the film's."", 'some profoundly eccentric characters but the performances seemed a little forced and the connection you need to carry them over the line was missing for the most part.', ""based upon charles dickens novel david copperfield 1850, this latest adaptation starring dev patel as the titular lead chronicles copperfield's erratic life from rags to riches. set during victorian-era england, the personal history of david copperfield commences with his idyllic childhood living on a beach in an overturned boat through to early adulthood after a somewhat turbulent string of events. being a fan of dicken's works as well as having written and starred in the 2012 tv film armando's tale of charles dickens, iannucci appeared to be an appropriate choice to adapt dicken's 600 page behemoth for the screen. along with co-writer and regular collaborator simon blackwell, iannucci found himself drawn towards the comedy featured within the novel. dev patel shines as david copperfield, and he's joined by a magnificent ensemble cast comprised of some of britain's finest. peter capaldi a previous collaborator of iannucci's, most notably known for his work on the thick of it features as the scheming mr. micawber, and hugh laurie delivers a wonderfully mad performance as mr. dick a frantic, paranoid man plagued with what seems to be a loose form of schizophrenia. tilda swinton is another fantastic addition as betsy trotwood, and ben whishaw's performance as the seedy uriah heep lends a slightly more antagonistic presence to a storyline largely lacking such a component. it is evident both iannucci and blackwell are fans of the source material they're adapting, as the personal history of david copperfield is a vibrant, charming piece of work that is irresistibly fun. driven by a wonderful cast and a fast-paced storyline spanning many years, it is a film made with affection that is an absolute joy to watch."", ""to those who love this book, please stay away from this loose adaptation. i'm not against putting your own spin on a piece of literature, but when you lose sight of the soul of the source material, i have no interest. a truly excellent cast is wasted on this directors self-indulgent production. this is not david copperfield. if you feel the need to tell whatever story this thing is, please do it under another name."", ""a very dynamic film, david copperfield lures you into his intriguing life stories. unfortunately i haven't read the original but could still appreciate the flair and narrative of the film. this would have been a treat for those who are familiar with dickens's work. this eventful and fluid manner of story telling nicely transitions into this film. some decent performances by dev patel and the rest of the cast. it was also a pleasantly diverse film that modernised this classic novel. this may not appeal to a large mainstream audience as some cultural sensitivity is needed to see something in this film. i'm glad i went and enjoyed this modern spin on a classic tale."", ""love everything armando iannucci has done so far but this doesn't work and isn't funny.\nturning dickens's comedy drama into a slapstick farce didn't work for me."", ""i saw this film at the home arts centre in manchester on 26th january.\ni would first like to say to all the reviewers who have a problem with the multi ethnic casting - lighten up and catch up. it might not be too common yet in period films but this kind of colour blind casting is hardly unheard of on 21st century tv, and as the director pointed out in an interview on the today programme this morning radio 4, 28th january it has been used in theatre for the past 10-15 years. the director explained his choice of actors as, he had always thought dev patel would be ideal for the role of david copperfield because he portrays the right combination of naivety, strength and intelligence for the character. following that he wanted to cast the significant roles in the film equally well and to give it a slightly modern feel, and that meant looking at actors of all ethnic backgrounds. the bame actors who play the significant supporting roles of ham, markham, mrs steerforth, dr chillip, mr wickfield and agnes wickfield are exactly right for those roles and i found nothing jarring in it their presence at all. likewise the caucasian actors let's not forget them who play dora, mr dick, mr and mrs micawber, aunt betsy trotwood, are perfectly cast.\nit is inevitable that a film adaptation is going to miss out some of what is in the original novel. film is a different medium and isn't going to have space for all the subplots or all of the characters. but this adaptation is faithful to dickens's main characters and plot developments, and it brings out all the comic elements in both. to take a familiar example, there is something hilariously absurd in betsy trotwood's obsession with keeping people from riding donkeys over her lawn. this makes the film a delight to watch, and if it skates over the more tragic elements of the story, this isn't a fault.\nit is also visually enjoyable due to the imaginative direction. this draws the audience in from the start. the opening scene has david copperfield starting to read his own story on stage in front of an audience, and soon after he begins, he turns and walks through the backdrop into the real norfolk countryside and walks the viewer to the house where he is being born. there are several such surreal scene changes throughout, which are both unexpected and pleasing to watch.\nthis isn't a classic film but it is a respectful adaptation, very funny and entertaining, and well worth watching."", 'really enjoyable sunday night viewing. the film felt dreamy and this worked well with the narrator recounting the memories of his life whilst writing and showing us how life itself the sole source for writing. the whole thing had a bit of a wes anderson feel but this may have been because tilda swinton was in the film and the characters were very eccentric! definitely give it a go!', 'a great cast puts a wonderful spin on david copperifeld i found hugh laurie especially wonderful in his role but the film was wonderfully heartwarming somehow without having any specific memorable wow moments. overall an enjoyable film.', ""wasn't really expecting to like this much given the somewhat mixed reviews, but i did really like it. good performances across the board and the humour landed more than i was expecting. hugh laurie has kept all of his comedic talent from blackadder - he really is just hilarious. even lines that are clearly not funny got a chuckle out of me because of him. dev patel also shines as the lead role, and having never read the book i enjoyed seeing the story play out. the final half an hour was definitely the weakest - the emotional moments didn't really work for me, and the framing device of the film felt a bit unnecessary. it always annoys me when a framing device for the story is set up at the beginning and isn't even referenced again until the very end. but the visuals are really good, the set design is fantastic and the film on the whole is just a good time."", 'the film begins with plenty of quips and old fashioned british humour. slightly reminded me of the grand budapest hotel in its manner and humour. this film does not deserve anything near what some of the reviews are giving. clearly many turned up expecting it to be a raucous, laugh out loud comedy which was never promised. what it does do is stick to dickensian values and humour throughout.\nmy main gripe is that the balance of the film seems a little off. the beginning and middle parts cross over nicely, however there is a good 30 minutes of rather dull dialogue without the stories moving along very much. the ending then all comes at once, whilst entertaining it compromises the storytelling values from the beginning of the film, perhaps to cram it into the two hour window.\noverall i predominantly enjoyed the script and the performances from the small ensemble of fine actors who were clearly enjoying their whacky roles.']",Armando Iannucci,Dev Patel,Aneurin Barnard,Peter Capaldi,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTcwY2Q1NDMtMDUwNi00NzY1LWI0NWYtOWNkZTY2NzRjYjY1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,A modern take on Charles Dickens's classic tale of a young orphan who is able to triumph over many obstacles.

was simply unexpected. this wasn't a film like the dark knight which provides authenticity to a sci-fi world, or even inception which provided clarity after simple attention. this is a film that is intended to be searched, discovered, thought of, looked at, and inspected in every way possible. and yet, this a film intended to give no easy answers, no simple clarity, no instant gratification.

mulan,Animation Family Adventure,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120762/,"[""there are two things i love about this movie, aside from its stunning and beautiful animation.  one is that i love the fact that disney is exploring legends from other cultures and i am so glad it brought us this one.  the other is that i just wanted to stand up and cheer at this great heroine.  i am a huge fan of disney movies, but most of the heroines, while spunky, are still just your basic damsel in distress.  i loved mulan's character.  she was strong, she was powerful, she could do anything she wanted, and she overcame much diversity.  i was thrilled to see the portrayal of a strong female character surviving because of her own integrity and strength rather than because of her looks.  bravo, disney, for bringing us this wonderfully progressive chinese tale."", ""mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in chinese history. it tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national heroheroine. although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. as a chinese myself, i know the mulan story like millions of chinese people do. some people espcially chinese people may not like the disney version of mulan simply because disney didn't stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. not only did i have no problem with disney's decision to make modifications to mulan's story, i actually kinda appreciate that they did. cuz disney's retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. i mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in disney's mulan. in the disney version, mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient chinese society, where a woman's value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. so naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number reflection that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. this song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and i'm a guy! this song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. and now back to the movie, there's a lot to love about disney's mulan the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. the story is smoothly-paced and very believable. you have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. and i think disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real chinese people instead of the classic disney characters that we used to see. and they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me!

it has scenes ourside michael's house. the film opens with little scenes depicting each of the characters in their lives and contributing to character development from the start. during the phone call game, the film also has flashback scenes, which make the past memories somewhat more concrete. it also has a few sexually explicit scenes. other than that, the story and dialogue are pretty much the same.\nlastly, we must not expect all queer stories to tell empowering, optimistic stories. yes, this film is very dark and depressing, but it is just another prespective on life and individual experience. no queer character represents or talks on behalf of the whole queer community, nor do the characters in this film. they mostly manage to feel real within themselves, which is more important."", ""while the actors were all very convincing in their roles, and the art direction was satisfying, i still don't think i got the point of this film. so, regrets and arguments abound amongst a group of gay friends, how is this the fodder of film?

get lost in doubts and do not have to deal with an ego bigger than them. they act, they feel, they learn and repeat. they have so much to learn from that one day. i found all three young characters

star. it's a movie that is both a testament to resilience and belonging's cumbersomeness it's set against all of the vibrant music scenes in texas. noblezada is soulful, supported by powerful work from lea salonga as her protective aunt and by country musician dale watson. threaded with sincere storytelling, yellow rose makes the musical score evocative, alive after the credits roll, casting a

immigration, music, and the variety of ways we all try to become the people we want to be. while the acting can come off as a bit stiff with writing that is a little too superficial and full of tropes, the music of eva noblezada and dale watson, along with a critical story about the struggles of being undocumented and chasing your own dreams, make this very much worth a view!', ""the story of undocumented families in america is an important one, and deserves to be told. it's an emotional and evocative subject, which the film attempts to handle humanely and on a personal level.\nunfortunately, this film suffers from some bad casting and repetitive storytelling.\nbad casting\nour starring character, rose, has about 3 acting modes emotions. it's like she has separate little programs for sad or angry that run through a prescribed set of facial expressions and actions that play out the same way every time she copy and pastes that emotion. if you've seen her cry once, you've seen her cry every time.\ni caught myself being annoyed with her, rather than sympathetic, as she indulged in teenage dramatics.\nher singing voice, while lovely, is definitely not country. she favors the big, belting style of soul singers. occasionally, she'll remember and slip in a twang, but it's pretty rare, and only when she's singing with another country singer. her texan accent is likewise treated like a sweater in the middle of summer rarely put on and largely left forgotten.\nthe bar owner comes across as creepy and weirdly absent i kept expecting her to turn around and sell rose or something, instead of viewing her as a kindly good samaritan.\ndale, while a perfect country singer, never hits that paternal note, and more than one person in our group got the strange feeling that he and rose would wind up green-card married. which i know isn't what they were going for, so the actor chemistry is way off.\nrepetitive\nthere are only so many times you can see

change from the last movie i watched, which was save yourselves. the biggest problem with that movie was the lack of likeable characters. at least with this movie, you felt a connection to the main character and her plight. sure, there were some moments that make feel she's just being unreasonable, like when she storms off from dale watson. but otherwise, she's just acting like a teen would put in such a situation.\nanother part i liked about this movie is that even though it feature a teen lead character, and the guy who she befriends from the music store who actually isn't in it that much, the movie doesn't come across as a disney channel teen movie. it's a mature film. it stays away from anything dark or disturbing, but it doesn't pull punches when it shows the ice agents doing their raids to grab undocumented immigrants.\nand we get to see rose go through the writing process and finding inspiration from her surroundings and even with help from dale watson. not to say, this movie is about 'how to write and record a song'. but it does show how she takes her real life situation and is inspired to turn it into lyrics.\nnow, the ending is cliched, and typical of many of these kinds of films, hence dropping a point. and it's somewhat open-ended, because it's basically the new beginning of rose's journey. maybe if there's a sequel, it will play out like a star is born? haha, i don't think there will be a sequel.\nso, i was glad to be able to see this on the big screen. i imagine a lot of people will only get to experience this on their tv sets. i think if you can see it

the story is simple it tugs at your heartstrings. i like that the teen romance took a back seat and was just a small facet of the film and there was more focus on the songwriting and the music. which is beautiful and emotionally sung by the actress eva noblezada rose and country musician dale watson, who also stars in the film as well as a beautiful filipino lullaby sung by lea salonga. . rated

movie touches on not just the struggle of the virgin but other relationship issues as well that make the film relatable. its fun to watch andy slowly grow into a confident man who is able to find true love. the entire cast is great, especially the supporting friends of andy, as always paul rudd and seth rogen do not disappoint!', ""steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'the daily show', and then in various supporting roles. in virgin, carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. carell plays andy stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. one night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. his co-workers, david paul rudd, jay romany malco, and cal seth rogen initially tease andy about his situation. but it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. and so begins andy's quest into adulthood. andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. in addition, i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. i'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama it's a rolling in your seats comedy. still, every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. a good comparison would be 'the wedding crashers' from earlier this summer. virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. i particularly loved the ending of the film, which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick. without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'something about mary'. very light and fun it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. i would highly recommend."", ""just came out of a sneak preview for this film. it had me laughing every 30 secs. the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn't bought that large coke. there are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in bruce almighty and will ferrell anchorman the legend of ron burgendy in their movies. paul rudd is hilarious as always. i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas like p.s.. i think that seth rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments. i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. however, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. if you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. and, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those hip parents, don't take your kids to this movie. sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. it would make for some incredibly awkward moments."", ""this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. catherine keener was terrific as trish, and all of steve carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended."", ""so i just watched this for the first time. it was very funny. and it had a crazy amount of big names in it and i wasn't expecting it. and all of them do what they are for really well cause sure i kept noticing all these actors but right after they came on i started seeing them as there character. now it's hard to write some big review on this cause it's just a simple fun comedy and i'd def recommend it. and i do not really know what to say from here other then just check it out for yourself it's a classic and i can see why but ya know it's just a classic comedy nothing crazy ya know so do it check it out."", ""i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know  what to expect. the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a  lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. what a great surprise. i  laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes. this film is a must see  for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor.  ok.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother jack  palance? or small children. the language is filthy, the jokes are  very crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find  anywhere. what's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet  love story. my girlfriend and i both loved it.  steve carell is terrific, but like the office the supporting cast  really makes the film work. all of the characters have their flaws, but  they also have depth and likability. everyone pulls their weight and  the chemistry is perfect.  i can't wait to get the dvd. i'm sure it will be up there with office  space for replays and quotable lines."", ""hey have you ever wanted to watch a really good flic? well, here it is! our little friend, steve is so so adorable in this story! it's a pathway to genuine desire. please wait until the end for the lesson! you'll love it. and the cast, oh my gosh! they are magnificent, and so young p."", ""i thought this movie would be funny knowing how funny steve catrell was in bruce almighty and his tv show the office but i was sadly mistaken. no matter how good or funny an actor is, it always starts with the writing, and the writing for this movie was terrible! steve wasn't funny and none of his very unlikable friends were funny. i'm no prude but the crass, vulgar, and just plain asinine sexual jokes  and i use that term loosely were ceaseless. maybe if you're a 12 year old boy you might like the dim-witted so not-funny humor, but it was an absolute insult to anyone who has a hint of intelligence. why people think that you have to be sexually filthy and crude in every sentence to be funny is beyond me. this movie would be good at a fraternity party, or a bachelor's party, where everyone is so smashed they don't know the difference. besides the complete lack of any real humor, the actors and actresses ha ha were very poor. i know steve catrell has talent, but it was definitely not reflected in this movie."", ""i have rewatched this idiotic movie a disturbing amount of times. it's just

this particular hillbilly family, their lives get wrecked time and time again. managing emotions is tough in the part of the usa deplored by the so-called elite, though there is no politicizing in

black bear,Drama Thriller,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601220/,"[""though i have some theories as to the reason behind - or, perhaps, meaning of - its non-traditional structure, they're really not that relevant when it comes to discussing 'black bear 2020'. that's because the thing is far more focused on delivering an in-the-moment emotional experience than a completely cohesive intelligent one, its mid-point shake-up seeming to exist primarily so that the writerdirector can tell the story he wants to tell without being constrained by traditional narrative form. it's difficult to describe what i mean without spoiling things so i'll just leave it at that. the film itself is a beguiling and engaging drama that opens with a filmmaker coming to stay at a beautiful cabin, seemingly in the hope of finding inspiration for her newest project, and having to navigate the tense relationship of the pregnant couple who owns it. like its protagonist, it's decidedly hard to read almost anything could happen and it wouldn't feel out of place. this makes for a surprisingly compelling experience, though. the characters are crafted with precision, both in terms of writing and in terms of performance, and the social dynamics that the plot explores are varied, interesting and often unexpected. sometimes, it feels a bit like a play, probably due to its small cast and near real-time unravelling. there's just something a bit claustrophobic about it all, which works in its favour as it helps to create an oddly enigmatic tone. as i've mentioned, it's hard to discuss the picture without spoiling a key aspect of it. i suppose i'll just leave it at this it's an entertaining and unique experience that features some great performances including perhaps aubrey plaza's best yet. 710."", ""i appreciated that this movie tried to do something different, i just don't think it was that great of a story. the main reason to watch it is for aubrey's performance. that's all this is about."", 'i never knew aubrey plaza is such a good actress! the film is captivating and really showcases how good aubrey plaza is.', ""this is definitely a film that leaves you with more questions than answers. there are some high points in the acting, but, in the end, there is just way too much dialogue and not enough story. that being said, the strongest part of this film is aubrey plaza. she is fantastic in her role as allison and the only reason i am rating this 710. if you watch this film for anything, watch it for aubrey plaza's performance."", 'black bear is an indie movie, which from the start feels unique and experimental. the music and general atmosphere in the beginning is extraordinary and keeps you waiting for a misterious and dark journey into the mind of the charactar. unfortunately, the overall premise of the film seems plain and pointsless at some point. the movie is missing a clear red line. this can be good for certain types of movies, but here the movie just feels like it is floating through space without clear direction. nonetheless, black bear is interesting enough to keep the viewer intrigued threw its full run time. especially artists, writers and creatives should enjoy this movie since it carefully depicts the process of creativity. nonetheless, it feels like the something more and deeply meaningfull is hidden in this movie. 610.', ""started out fine, seemed to be going somewhere, then they throw a bunch of vague unexplained gobbledygook at the audience. now, i went to art school, and i studied screenwriting, so i can roll with symbolism, metaphors, and surrealism with the best of them, but a filmmaker has to decide whether they're making a film for a mass audience or for themselves. i have no doubt the director of this knows exactly what it all means, but that director failed to make it known to the audience. fail."", ""aubrey plaza is on fire emily the criminal, ingrid goes west, the white lotus, and this. she has become the queen of small white lotus aside complex and intelligent films where she has the opportunity to show what a wonderful and unique actress she is. this movie is not a good as the others, but plaza is just as good in this as she is in the others. this complicated, almost anthology, weaves the three staring characters, of which plaza is one, in a varied take and look on the three main characters' experiences in filmmaking and on a lake house. christopher abbott and sarah gadon are terrific in multiple roles. they manage to be interesting and believable and diverse enough to make you think, what the hell am i watching?. what is real?

an artist's social struggle and the many ways one can touch other people's lives. in my opinion, essentially it is a film about the intricacy of everyday relationships and an artist's struggle between their social life and their work. it is about self-obsession and betrayal. and the loose way these themes have been portrayed in, gives you an odd sense of rhythm, the kind that you find in an actual conversation. at the end of the day the film feels like a conversation, and a beautiful and moving one at that. with the help of brilliant acting and simple but alluring cinematography."", ""what a

people over the years, you will get a lot from this film and be able to relate to it and all the interesting characters. people's ideals and motivations change throughout their lives, and it's reflected here. the past is remembered differently by different people. while some can move on from the past, others cannot. some people grow and change while others remain the same. the story in the film reflects all of this beautifully. maybe if you're still very young, relatively inexperienced, and haven't done much, or lived, or traveled, this isn't the movie for you. but if you are okay with

filmmaking. my only criticism was the ambient lighting was at times distracting."", ""i guess you can see why soderbergh thought this might fly. three accomplished, intelligent, charismatic actresses, each of them capable of improvising scenes, developing interesting characters and building relationships without the benefit of an actual script. and, yes, meryl streep, diane wiest and candice bergen are all eminently watchable. unfortunately, that's no substitute for a strong story, well-crafted scenes and smart dialogue. let them all talk the title seeming more like the underlying concept than anything pertinent to the content is just a rambling, undisciplined, mostly tedious attempt at fashioning a movie out of a not-especially-inspired situation and a rather time-worn back story. it doesn't help that much about the writeragent set up is unbelievable, that it's indifferently directed, extremely slow, often poorly lit and blighted by a dull b-story that involves two seriously dull characters. one sort-of satisfying late scene between streep and bergen and a last-minute surprise twist isn't anywhere near enough to save the enterprise."", 'a film like a tent. you recognize the director and the art of actors, the meaning of improvisation and the realism of message. and, scene by scene, you discover the freshness of honest perspective about family, friendship, duties and

very strange movie. most of it is improvised shudder and the result is so slack and inconsequential that it barely registers as entertainment like a filmed adaptation of brian eno's ambient records of the eighties.\nmannered naturalism is the hardest trick for an actor to pull off though woody allen can do it in his sleep. but meryl streep is the absolute master. she makes such a brilliant art out of throat clearing, 'pausing with meaning,' and a whole arsenal of seemingly random face-touching that it's a wonder to behold. you know it's artificial, but you can't take your eyes off it.\nin the hands of an amateur, however, mannered naturalism is exhausting. poor lucas hedges, who plays meryl's nephew, just can't stop working the tics and sniffs and meaningless pauses. his hands wander over his face constantly, and he makes the simple act of 'listening' and we watch him listen a lot into something studied and inauthentic. even in the wide shots you can see him busily twitching away, actively engaged in being 'real.' when, at the end of the movie,he energetically gazes at a pair of photographs of his younger self, it's amazing to see what he looks like when he's still. and the photos give the better performance by far.\nfor a full hour let them all talk is utterly casual, static and fatuously chatty. and then in the middle of a scene with gemma chan as meryl's agent the movie suddenly becomes about something. both dianne wiest and candace bergen channeling gena rowlands snap into focus. all this vague jabber has apparently been preparing us for the heartrending moment when wiest's character stops the film in its tracks to talk about the stars in a way that made me almost weep. then, thank god, bergen and streep have a killer scene together gorgeous, and subtle - that makes the slog of the first half almost worth the time. i've never had a chance to realize what a terrific actress candace bergen is. and her work here is sublime.\nthen, unfortunately, the ending of the movie is handed over to hedges, who can't stick the landing, and who makes the act of staring into space seem as natural as juggling lobsters.\nhowever, there is definitely something to be said for a film that lets us look at and listen to a group of women in their seventies. yes, they could've used a real script. but if you can make it to third act, there is actual meat on these

the stand in,Comedy,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7970348/,"[""up until the first half of the film, i kept waiting for any comedy scene that might come up. but after the first half i realized that this is definitely not a comedy. since drew barrymore has been known for doing many romantic comedies, i thought this one will be one of them. even though this idea of switching places have been done before many times, the idea of the film about a movie star with anger management issue, as she steps out of the spotlight and becomes a recluse, is interesting in a way. it's very poorly executed. mainly it's because it's very hard to sympathize with either characters, candy black is very mean and foulmouthed, and her stand-in who seemed like a nice person at first, turned out to be an opportunist, who wants to steal her identity and become a movie star herself. i guess the only normal character was michael zegen, except the weird story he tells about the nazi incident !!!! also in what world is the stand-in supposed to be an exact copy of candy black, with her obvious change in her nose, and why does she speaks in this weird tone of voice?? drew barrymore is a lovely actress, but this film is very bad on some many levels. what a waste of talent for great supporting actors like t.j. miller, ellie kemper and holland taylor. now that we know it's not a comedy, i wish i could say it's a drama, or a thriller, but it's also not that."", ""it had it's moments and could have been really good.... but ultimately it was a bit naff."", ""this was beyond bad from start to finish. do yourself a favour and do not rent or watch this horror of a movie. made it through only because we paid for it. it was an embarrassment for drew barrymore and we kept asking ourselves, why on earth did she do this movie. it's uncomfortable to watch and not at all funny."", ""the movie doesn't suck that much. it's still watchable cause it's drew barrymore, or course, but i'm not really satisfied with it. i thought the genre is comedy, but after i've watched the whole movie, it didn't feel like a comedy. it's more like a drama  thriller. the part where the stand-in started doing illegal stuff, it gave me a mild chilling vibe. it can easily turn into a thriller movie.\nas a comedy it gave me zero out of 10 stars. as a thriller it gave me 3 out of 10 stars. the only reason i gave it 5 stars is drew. actually, she's the only reason i decided to watch this movie."", ""ok, i understand the bad reviews because the movie was presented as a comedy, but it's not a comedy at all. it's more of a drama  thriller movie and within those genres it works very well. drew barrymore did an excellent job, she played two roles, this depressed, overwhelmed woman with severe problems and on the other hand there is this other character, who at first seems to be a happy girl with problems but innocent, although little by little she is showing her true essence. so if you are going to see this movie, i recommend you not to see it as a comedy, because you will not find jokes, funny scenes, etc. see this movie for what it is, a drama with touches of thriller.\nand i repeat, drew barrymore really did an excellent job here!"", ""i enjoyed this film. i almost didn't watch it after reading the reviews but was able to see a few that really explained the genre. i'm glad i gave it a chance. it is definitely a dark comedydrama with a bit if a twisted thriller in there too. barrymore was excellent as usual and her creepy stand-in played her part well. this is an odd little film and it is worth watching for those who want to see something interesting with good production."", ""it's that bad and boring. stopped it at 38 minutes. never. going. back."", 'this was a great idea for a movie but not a good movie!! neither of the characters drew plays have any charisma. not funny either  marketed as a comedy.', ""the story is a bit trite. a few laughs though so not terrible. barrymore's performance is really very good i'll have to admit. pity the script wasn't up to it."", 'a comic drama.\nit is about a great actress who after a scandal sees her career fall and how her double takes the opportunity to return her stardom but at inter things get out of control.\nquality.\nentertaining\na kind of game for twins but for adults.\nfew sexual and situational jokes.\nnice to see drew berrymore on screen.\ntalk about really doing what we want and being at peace with ourselves, leaving appearances and always seeking to be ourselves and be okay.\neven daring to do what we always wanted to do.\na movie to have a good time.', ""no no no, this was a bad wknd overall for movies, this ranks worst. wait for your next sandler movie, concentrate on talk show. this movie doesn't deserve synopsis review."", 'i liked it, probably moved by the admiration and empathy i feel for drew barrymore, always captivating and talented, here we have a simple and light comedy, with a dramatic, fun and sweet pinch, sometimes exaggerated, raw drew, almost without makeup, disheveled and bad dressed up, almost people like us when we are at home on a rainy weekend or with covid...

is outstanding. some brilliant performances. any hoot, it is a great distraction from events going on in the real world at the moment. i highly recommend it.', ""in the last few years gerard butler, sadly, has become a synonym for a movie flop. there has rarely been a movie in the last five years with butler in it, that was not either bad or completely awful.\nthe last of which, to name few were, the last part of the fallen trilogy, angel has fallen, the less than exciting wwii thriller hunter killer and one of the worst movies to be made in the last few years, geostorm.\nknowing all this i went into greenland with a certain level of skepticism. luckily, butler seems to have gotten a lot smarter in his choices because greenland is a quite entertaining motion picture.\nwhile i am not a fan of disaster movies, mostly because they always follow the same boring concept namely, a family or gets separated for some stupid reason and tries to find each other again over the next two hours while their journey is complicated by various obstacles of human or nature kind.\ngreenland is no doubt a disaster movie but fortunately it is a little more exciting and creative than most of its kind over the last few years have been.\nthe movie begins with john garrity butler visiting his wife allison morena baccarin and their son nathan. john and allison are separated but they seem to get along fine. nathan is fascinated by the stars and the asteroid that is shooting towards earth. soon the garritys invite some friends over, when a presidential alert appears on their tv and phone telling them to pack some bags and drive to a close by airfield.\nwhen they get there they are ushered in and just before they are about to board the plane the separation plot kicks in. admittedly it's not as stupid as usual.\nnow this might sound like your typical disaster movie but trust me it's not quite.\ngreenland is smart in how it handles it's characters and the plot is not always straight forward.\nthe movie tries less to create tension with the looming disaster but rather does so through the human element and the different characters the family members meet on their way.\nwe only get to experience what the family members do. there are no five or six main characters that each have their own agenda.\neven when they're separated, the garritys stay the focus of the movie. they meet good and bad people along their journey and what i liked in particular was the honesty with which the director handles these characters. many people are selfish and greedy and even in situations like this one, where working together is most important, people still only think of themselves.\nthe movie works also because butler and baccarin have a very good chemistry. they are the couple that has had hard times but still loves each other and would do anything to stay a family.\nbutler is really good here. as good as he hasn't been in years. it's not a very difficult role or something that would be beyond his skillset but it is more serious and dramatic than his usual tough guy parts. quite a few times i was happy to see that he can do more than growl and butcher an american accent. granted, he still butchers it but at least his character is so charming and likable that we can overlook it.\nthe love and tenderness he shows in his face a few times is one i have never seen of him and, in a particularly important scene, we see the self loathing and disgust in his face.\ni believe he always had it in him and i am glad he finally chose a movie that allowed him to bring out his full talent.\nbaccarin is good too, especially on her own. she hasn't had too many major roles yet in movies but i hope she will soon. she really is a capable actress.\ngreenland is certainly worth watching and if you have the chance and the current situation allows it, go see it next month when it's released. it makes for a welcome change of pace."", ""first, let me confess and get this out of the way, i do like gerard butler.\nhowever, that is not why i think this movie is so good.\nthis was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film.\nwas this film totally perfect? no.\nwere there any mistakes made in the film? there may have been, but you would have to look very hard to find them.\nthe production values were very high. the acting was very well done. everything had an expensive, polished look to it.\nthe cinematography, acting, editing, sound and sfx were all up there.\nthe budget i believe, was 35 million and every single penny of that is up on the screen for you to enjoy.\ndo not allow the negative reviewers to scare you away from watching this film!\nif you do, you will be robbed of experiencing a very good action movie.\nit seems like some people watch a movie with the sole intention of trying to pick it apart!\nsome people say that all of this is been done before. well maybe in a way, it has.\nthink about it. just how many different ways can you make an end of the world film?\nlook where we are. it's 2020. do you know how many end of the world movies have been made?!\nhundreds, if not thousands! so to be honest, it's kind of hard to come up with an idea that is completely original. they say the devil is in the details. the truth of the matter is that in all of these end of the world movies that have been made so far, the differences between them is in the details!\nfor instance, we already know from the trailers that a planet killing comet is going to hit.\nand yes, we know that there are going to be people panicking, and experiencing hardships, and all kinds of destruction, etc., etc., etc.\nso when you consider all the movies that are made with that general plot outline, the only way they can vary from each other is in all of the many details.\nfor instance, take a movie script, copy it 100 times, and give a copy to 100 different directors and film crews. when everything is said and done, you will end up with 100 movies all about the same thing.\nbut all of these movies will be completely different from each other. they will have a different look, feel, atmosphere, technical expertise, flavor, etc.\nand the reason that they are all completely different from each other, is because there are so many 1000s and 1000s of small details that make up a movie that cause these movies to be completely different from each other.\nso like i said, the devil is in the details. and the details are what make a movie either good or bad.\nall in all, i think that greenland is a very well done movie.\nso yes, when you sit down to watch the movie, you already know that supposedly, a comet is going to destroy the world. but you don't really know exactly how it's going to happen. and you don't know exactly all of the infinitely small details that join together and ultimately bring you to that event.\ni thoroughly enjoyed this movie.\nis it the 'comet ends the world film' to end all, 'comet ends the world films'? probably not.\nbut this film is definitely worth watching. you will be thoroughly entertained.\nall of the main actors are people that you actually end up caring about.\nwere some aspects of the movie glossed over at the expense of other parts? perhaps.\nso all in all, let me just say this\nthis was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film.\nand i believe that you will really enjoy it!\nbecause ultimately, the goal of a film such as this, is to entertain you.\nand greenland really succeeds."", ""greenland is somewhat fun and entertaining yet, this movie is creepy with cliches. so much so that i feel a real person did not write it. gerard butler carries the weight as the alpha caring father. lucky for him he had just one child. no telling what the script would have done with three kids but, i know it would have just simply worked out and they would make that plane to greenland in 5 minutes even though they are in georgia. it will work out. the keys will be in the drawer. the medicine will be there. dad will have a 50 acre ranch. the truck will have a full tank of gas. only dad will figure out to drive backwards. phew, a turkey sandwich shows up. oh, a truck just happens to be going to lexington. then, the cell phone issue. wtf! it's a real bad movie with much potential to be so meaningful. yet, it's another fine example of our degrading film industry. if i

the script had so many clichés, it was predictable, it lacked depth, it didn't give the actors a chance to act. it left me feeling like it was written to be easily consumed by the viewer.. i love action movies, i love super hero movies and this was arguably worse than thor love and thunder. other than that, i'd love to see this character in a new film with different writers."", ""i thought this movie was kinda fun. the pacing was good, i was never bored. the action was pretty intense and well shot. i don't understand the bad reviews. i guess people just pile on sony marvel movies after things like madame web. i enjoyed morbius and the first venom. all the other sony movies kinda suck. i like how this is rated r and the kills are violent. this movie kinda reminded me of the tarzan from 2016 which i loved. the only issue i had was the rhino. a tough character to adapt to film. in the comic it's easy to make him massive and powerful by just wearing a suit. the version from amazing spider man 2 was horrible. here they rely on some science experiment and cgi. it doesn't look good at all. doesn't ruin the movie but it's just hard to bring that character to life in film. overall i really enjoyed this movie."", ""i think kraven achieved everything it wanted to achieve, and i'm surprised to say i don't hate it. it's a simple turn your brain off and enjoy kind of action movie. i came in expecting something corny and repetitive from marvel's fantasy mafia movie and while there were a lot of awkward character writing and inconsistent pacing - as well as janky cgi - i was pleasantly surprised to see several attempts at deeper themes and a decent art direction. its simplicity keeps the whole thing cohesive and easy to follow. there was no point in the movie where i was completely taken out by the story direction, or felt like there were loose ends and plot holes. it's solid, simple, and a bit boring. all in all, i give it a 7 for being a little better than mid."", ""there have been five sony spider-man universe movies so far venom 1-3, morbius, and madame web. to me, they are in the range between fine and the worst movie i've ever seen. now, the sixth and thankfully final instalment is kraven the hunter. yet again, the filmmakers try and give a bad guy the chance to be good. this tells the origin story of yet another spider-man villain that doesn't have spider-man in it. after the death of their mother, sergei kravinoff aaron taylor-johnson and his brother dmitri fred hechinger get taken in by their ruthless crime lord with a weakness allergy father nikolai russel crowe. sergei gets his powers in a dumb way, then he becomes the world's greatest hunter. throw in a few more baddies into the mix such as rhino alessandro nicola and a guy literally called the foreigner christopher abbott, and you have one hell of a party. oh yeah, there's a love interest named calypso ariana debose who literally doesn't need to be here. i actually had hope for this movie. when i heard it was going to be rated 14a i was like finally! a movie about a violent villain is actually going to be violent! i thought it would've started with venom, but whatever. to be fair, the violent action was entertaining in this one, despite the bad cgi. some of the actors had fun, despite the horrible script. given time, i could've written it better. it blows my mind how many talented actors signed up for this. adr automated dialog replacement is a pretty common practice in filmmaking, where they re-record dialog to make it sound better. normally, it's not noticeable, until now. sometimes if you stare at people's mouths while they're speaking, the sound doesn't even link with the dialog. the best part about kraven the hunter is the action, and the fact that this mediocre universe is finally coming to a whimpering end. still, not as atrocious as madame web. rest in pieces."", 'i was very much looking forward to seeing this movie, i like aaron taylor-johnson and this seemed like it was going to be able to show off his talent. i could not have been more wrong. now, credit where credit is due, the score was great and taylor-johnson did the best with what he was given. the quality was brought down by the sketchy cgi some looked fine, others terrible and the atrocious acting from the supporting actors! granted, the script did no one any favours, but it seemed like a few actors did not even try to make it work. this made it very difficult to stay in the fictional world because the dialogue and the characters felt so disconnected. the main female lead also felt a bit shoe horned in to get the feminism points and it took away character development from some of the other characters. sony needs to throw in the towel with super hero ips and stop dragging good actors down with their box office failures.', ""7.510\nin my opinion, kraven the hunter delivers an entertainingly violent final mission in what potentially marking sony's last attempt at a spider-man villain spin-off, and when you compare the spin off films apart from the venom trilogy, i think kraven the hunter has already surpassed the awful madame web just by the violent itself even if the main story didn't engage most of the audience except me who found it engaging enough to enjoy, added with good addition to the film with both russell crowe and one of the emperor twins in gladiator ii, fred hechinger, the violent was fun, and kraven himself stands out as a compelling antihero, the film is far from a groundbreaking cinematic achievement and its flaws are evident, the overall thrilling hunt is pure entertainment, it serves as a passable, and in my opinion a pretty good conclusion to sony's strange and seemingly confused spider-man universe, of all the characters introduced, tom hardy's venom and aaron taylor-johnson's kraven are the two i'd most like to see return, perhaps in a future mcu."", ""most movies fail to deliver after reshoots and delays but kraven the hunter is an exception. the rated action scenes are thrilling! though few cgi effects are not up to the master level. the movie did justice to kraven's fighting skills. it would had been more interesting if it were in a marvel universe, but they wouldn't have concentrated on this solo character due to their already packed up multi universe, having no adequate time to focus on individual marvel character's origin story, especially an anti-hero or a villain. kraven can be craven for another sequel or it's introduction in the marvel universe just like it was craved for x-men, defender's daredevil and venom."", ""there's some fun to be had watching kraken the hunter. atj gives a nice performance and he definitely has the physicality for the role. i had fun watching him in action and think he was a great choice to play kraven. russell crowe is also an enjoyable presence on screen. the plot doesn't make a ton of sense once you start breaking it down, but the actions scenes are fast paced and unique. it definitely benefits from the r rating, letting us see kraven's use of mostly edged weapons in detail. overall an enjoyable movie that over-performed my somewhat low expectations. i think it's a better watch than the last two venom movies, morbius, and definitely madame web."", ""personally, i expected a lot from this movie, since it was r-rated, more blood and more creative action scenes, but the movie could not create this, despite the character, hunter kraken is a really charismatic and solid character, it was even the style of this character that carried the action scenes, but a suitable script could not be found. he couldn't do it in a way that could be based on the villain character, the designs in the locations were very strange and he combined it with cgi. i have a style that loves cgi. also, the movie was not entertaining at all, it could not create that entertainment at all. i personally saw a movie that did not happen, but they had the potential to do it. i liked the entertaining structure of deadpool  wolverine, they had filled it with blood, but this was missing in this movie.""]",Shawn Linden,Devon Sawa,Camille Sullivan,Nick Stahl,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU0YTI5ODAtN2NmMS00YTg3LTgyNDItN2RmOWEzOTkzZjcyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Kraven's complex relationship with his ruthless father, Nikolai Kravinoff, starts him down a path of vengeance with brutal consequences, motivating him to become not only the greatest hunter in the world, but also one of its most ..."

down, and not much that really made me relate and connect to the characters and their situation either, meaning that as a result, i didn't care about them. it's a shame, because i was really hoping to

down by repetitiveness. tom hanks is still great as always. he always puts a lot into each of his roles that makes each of his characters stand out from one another with this one being a reluctant father figure who chooses to help those in need. the direction by paul greengrass is great. i haven't seen much of his work but i'm interested in seeing what else he can do besides this and captain philips. both of which tom hanks starred in. helena zengel is good at points and weak in others so i can't praise her performance nor can i bash it. this has an interesting concept of a civil war captain who travels from town to town reading the news to people stepping outside of his comfort zone to help someone in need. i think this film did a great job at showing the unrest in 1880s texas. the film shows the tension between the people of texas and the union forces stationed there. it also does a good job at making you feel for some of the characters especially hanks' character. the cinematography is also great. greengrass does an incredible job at showing off these great landscapes with each shot feeling a little more different than the last. my big issue with this film comes down to its repetitiveness, pacing, and slow descent into boredom. there is a cool action set piece at the beginning but after that point, the film starts to throw similar situations of peril one after the other. after a while, you start to say to yourself haven't we already seen this before? it doesn't help that the pacing is awful at times with some scenes going on for way to long while others are cut way too short like the scene where a town is basically controlled by outlaws. we spend so little time there and it was a very interesting scenario that is cut away from. i also take issue with the resolution of the film being not great. without spoiling the film, we see what happens and you think that that's it but then the movie goes on for another 25-30 minutes and it's really boring aside from one 3 minute long scene with hanks. it should have ended where i thought it was gonna end. if you like tom hanks or western movies then you might get something out of this but you can wait until it comes out on dvd, blu-ray, or rental to watch it."", 'tom hanks is so unbelievable in each role he plays. no, this is not his best, but enjoyable. a slow burn of a movie worth your

one night in miami...,Drama,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10612922/,"[""overall, i think this was a very fine film. affecting, intelligent. and a great meeting of the minds what-if scenario. some things were better than others. the actor who played ali nailed a young version of the greatest. the malcolm x character was played with some of the real malcom's fervor and zeal. but having read malcom x's biography, i find the real malcolm was stronger and, at times, more severe than he was played here. i understand though the film wanted to capture more of his humanity and vulnerability, which i could appreciate. the boxing scenes didn't look like anything like the way the real ali fought and were a bit flat. and it took quite a while for the film to get going. but once it does... once it brings these four great men together, it's very good."", ""a stylish and promising debut from regina king. while not as constantly engaging as i was hoping, it still features brilliant performances all around and some of the strongest directing i've seen all year i would love to see the oscar winning actress become an oscar nominated director!"", 'laughs, cries, and times of reflection and deep thought. this film takes you through them all. great job to everyone who made this project come alive.', ""this film was more message than a movie. the ideals behind the meeting are important to learn and understand. the acting was well done but overall all it was dull and very wordy. i do recommend a watch but wouldn't be something i'd put in repeat."", ""well some people might find this movie boring with only men talking to each other for like 2 hours but it's way more deeper than that. the script of this movie is just so powerful, strong and deep. it is full of powerful and nice lines with many important topics. performances are brilliant by everyone. the conversations and performances of this movie kept me engaged all the time, they are the strongest elements in it. one night in miami is a stylish very well crafted movie with a heavy screenplay and superb performances."", ""i went into this film with high hopes, and maybe it was because of that fact i didn't enjoy myself, or simply the fact that the film was not what i expected it to be, but one night in miami is unfortunately a dull dud from regina king and nothing more than another play made into a film that we simply did not need. what frustrates me most about this film is that there is many little things about it that could have been great. i get what the film was trying to do. it's very talky, but still, it could have provided a clear and important conversation on the importance of racial equality among the other things it grazes upon- but sadly, the script is too muttled to focus on a single idea, and too distracted by its four characters to do anything significant with them. 4 legends ahead of their time, people who not only stood up for racial equality in a trying time, but helped lead a revolution through it all- and yet, we simply sit here watching them in a plain hotel room, with little to nothing going on. it's not even just a missed opportunity, it's a dull experience in general. there is very little to keep your focus during this movie, and little to be learned after it. are its values important? of course, but sadly so many films have handled the ideas it tries to place so much better, and sadly, one night in miami is just a forgetful film experience.\nmy rating 4.510"", ""powerful film. regina king did such a great job at directing and the film looked beautiful. the subject matter was incredibly interesting and couldn't have come at a better time."", ""for the first 20 minutes or so of this film, i thought this definitely feels more like a play than a movie. but then the conversations got going. and the actors started truly inhabiting their roles. and i stopped wondering how much of this night's events were fictional. by that point, it did not just feel cinematic. it felt moving. the performances alone were worth it, but their moments talking together might stick with me even longer. kudos to powers and king for giving a stageplay new life and new relevance."", 'absolutely loved this movie from start to finish! i love how everything came together and told such wonderful stories individually but also collectively. i would watch it all over again.', ""what works on a theatre stage, doesn't necessarily work on the big screen. 'one night in miami' is proof of it. it might have been a good idea to write a stage play about what could have happened during the night in february 1964, when malcolm x, cassius clay, sam cooke and jim brown spent an evening in a motel room. but it wasn't a good idea to adapt that play into a movie.\nthe result is predictable four men talking in a room. what they talk about is interesting music, politics, race relations, and how they interact. they discuss, they tease each other, they exchange insults, they almost fight, they drink except for malcolm x, they laugh now and then not very often.\nbut that's not enough for a good movie. the film needs a story with a beginning and an end, it lacks action and suspense, the characters are built around their place in the history books, not as if they were real human beings. the conversations are not smooth and natural, but feel contrived and artificial. the whole thing has the feel of a history lesson.\nto give the movie a more cinematic feel, scenes have been added before and after the meeting in the motel room. they are meant to put some perspective on the discussions in the room. but they make things even worse. they feel like add-ons, and some of them are hammering in a message about race relations that's already very clear.""]",Regina King,Kingsley Ben-Adir,Eli Goree,Aldis Hodge,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRhN2U5OTAtYzlkYi00MGM5LWFmYjctZTRkODllZGM5YThlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"A fictional account of one incredible night where icons Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown gathered discussing their roles in the Civil Rights Movement and cultural upheaval of the 60s."
promising young woman,Thriller Crime Drama,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9620292/,"[""i have 3 little ones. two boys and a girl. on one hand, i'd never want my sons to be accused of or punished for something they didn't do, on the other hand i'd never want anything to happen to my daughter  then especially no one believe her. i myself went through my own event at a halloween party almost ten years ago when i was a young 20 year old girl. i think what hurts more than the actual night, and the person who did it, it's all the family and close friends who didn't believe me, ignored me, or even blamed me. after a while you just stop talking about it. you shut it away.  then this brilliant movie comes into your life. this movie sends two clear messages it doesn't matter what you were wearing, how much you had to drink, your past relationships, if you made the first move... if you weren't cognitive enough to make a consensual choice, or you said no, or you fought it, seriously it was not your fault. and the other clear message, she gave each guy in the movie a chance to do the right thing and they chose not to. they actively chose to make the wrong choice. so, they were completely at fault and deserved their day of reckoning. i only wish i had a friend even half the character cassie is in this movie. my best friend since we were children said it was my fault because i was dressed too sexy i was dressed in a 1920's flapper costume from walmart  had a hoodie on top of it. we haven't spoken in years because of that. today, her words still haunt me more than that night and make me sick to my stomach. you're loved ones should have your back more than anyone. so the message of true devotion in friendship and sisterhood here was especially lovely. this isn't something that happens exclusively to only a certain type of woman, this happens to all women.  movies like this will be how we put an end to it for our future, our children  loved ones."", ""wow - an acting masterclass from carey mulligan. and if this film can make one person think twice about taking advantage of someone who can't defend themself it has done it's job. but it's a lot more than a film that sends a powerful message. it is sinister entertainment at its best. wonderful."", ""the subject matter is still sadly something that still needs to be taken seriously in today's society. needs to be shown especially to college  high school students. carrie did such a great job, i've never seen her play anything similar to this."", ""this movie blew me away.\ni went through basically the entire range of emotions before the movie was even over. it hit on everything that's made me so angry for such a long time. it was a vessel of that rage and it felt so good to see it depicted. more than that though, it felt like a story about the deep love we have for our friends.\nthe message was amazing in my opinion.....and the ending was perfect!"", 'i salute the effort to treat a topic too few movies are willing to tackle. but everything from the teasers to the promotion imagery, posters, etc. led me to believe the movie would push the concept a lot further than it did.. in the end i feel this would have made more of an impact if it had either gone a more seriousconservative and realistic route some situations are quite implausible, or the complete opposite, with someone being pushed over the edge and devolving into madnessviolence a la jokerjohn wick. as it stands the movie is too middle of the road, not knowing what it wants to be, just like the main character and it left me unsatisfied.', 'i want to give it a low score for the second part of the movie but a high score for the overall quality. i was speechless and disturbed during the second part of the movie. this is a unique film, one that makes you feel bad.', ""i'm flabbergasted that i'm only discovering this movie 3 years after it came out. i love every single actress and actor in this movie, and i'm shocked it wasn't a book made into a movie, it was so good and full of character depth. the plot centred around revenge was a very appealing bonus. all that said, the movie had a lot to live up to and it. did. it blew me away, and i would watch it again immediately except it left me feeling both sick and empty inside because there is just so much truth to the society we live in. the plot twists were almost too easy to see.... why? because.... men. i actually don't hate men, i don't want to. but here i am bawling about men anyway. now to feel better, i'll need to watch an uplifting fictional movie with men as the heroes shouldn't be hard to find. also, the soundtrack was wonderful. thank you for this masterpiece.""]",Emerald Fennell,Carey Mulligan,Bo Burnham,Alison Brie,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDMyNTQ5ODYtMjU3YS00MjM3LWFmOGMtZjZlNDA3YWE3YjM0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Nothing in Cassie's life is what it appears to be - she's wickedly smart, tantalizingly cunning, and she's living a secret double life.

pieces of a woman,Drama,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11161474/,"['opens on one of the most powerful long takes in recent memory, but not even the masterful performances by kirby and burstyn could save the dry 2nd and 3rd acts. resolution felt incomplete. kirby elevates an otherwise tough sit.', ""i lost my child in 2007 just before she was born and i watched this wondering would it be portrayed sympathetically. it was. the birth scene is part of the story but it is the fall out from the loss. the grief is soul destroying and it changes lives. me and my partner are not the same people we were before our daughter was born. both leads play this beautifully, the self destruction is honest. i know people struggle with the ending but sometimes life evolves and becomes 'normal' again. we've had 2 rainbow babies since our loss. the apple theme is true and accurately portrayed."", ""it's a well acted tragic story that starts off excellently, but falls apart bit by bit the longer it goes until it ends on a whimper, as if the story got tired. vanessa kirby is equal parts excellent, and yet underacted in a sort of apathetic manner, where it began to hurt the story itself because her behavior was not shown to have anything underlying it, but her surface level was her entire level. shia was excellent, as was the mother. the film is very much in the style of hungarian films, as the director is, and i say this in the way that this film could and would have been shot as a hungarian film and played out exactly the same, if it had not been north american. in fact, it feels like an american adaptation of an existing hungarian film, but this is it. the tone of the film jerks around somewhat, going with hard, every day realism, with odd smatterings of symbolism that just don't mesh well and come up like worn down speed humps on your drive, so instead of you getting seamless symbolism, they are stark and you are slapped aware of them when they show up. the dialogue is very good and realistic, except for a few instances where they get speechy and you start to fall out of the immersion because of it. the cinematography is very great, and the music works well. i think with some tweaks this could have been a great, even excellent movie, but what we got is a hampered result."", ""very powerful, but still subtle, drama. the opening birth scene is truly extraordinary, and vanessa kirby's performance in that scene - and throughout the film - is a masterclass. it's a brilliant portrait of a woman who for the majority of the film has things happening to her, people doing things they think she needs, agency well-meaningless removed. her core flinty resolve is hinted at throughout, and when it's finally allowed out it's beautifully expressed in a final few minutes that could feel like lazy grandstanding but is instead delivered with all the restraint needed. an excellent supporting cast too, especially shia laboeuf as her partner. moving, sensitive and well-crafted."", ""the screenplay and the resulting formal structure of the movie left me a bit puzzled.\ndid they try to parallel the experience of this young woman, surpassing a deep life crisis after a miscarriage, on the formal level and the structure of the movie? the film never recovers from its strong first 30 min, after this you have the feeling it breaks into pieces, like the life of this young woman itself. sequences seem fractured and shattered, not really motivated or combined in a convincing way. dialogue and acting often seems loosely improvised and unconnected.\nla beouf's part for example, the most unconvincingly motivated character for me, suddenly loosing any connection, vanishing out of sight. but that's exactly the way the grieving mother must have felt it herself! maybe they did that intentionally to give us the feeling of loss, pain, anger and emotional estrangement this woman is going through. strong supporting acts by ellen burstyn and molly parker. but the movie's core and center is vanessa kirby here, giving a breathtaking performance, she carries this film almost alone. in the end it doesn't leave you frustrated, it seems there's enough hope left for a new beginning in life."", ""overall, this movie is pretty decent. i have to say that i expected a bit more but in the end i wasn't really disappointed. vanessa kirby and shia labeouf were both great but there were moments in both of their performances that were just a little bit off. the highlight of the film has got to be its opening scene which is about 27 minutes long. this scene was absolutely incredible and highly salute them for their work. after that the movie goes up and down over and over again. it's meant to be sad and heartbreaking but i just didn't really feel that when i was watching."", 'that home birth scene was intense especially since i almost had a home birth 11 months ago thank god i decided to go with a hospital. i literally had to stop the movie and breathe because for the last few seconds i was inadvertently holding my breath. astounding performances, good film, but not a film i can watch a second time.']",Kornél Mundruczó,Vanessa Kirby,Shia LaBeouf,Molly Parker,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzY0Njg2OWMtYzA2My00NmJjLTk1ZDgtZDZhNTA4M2UzNDkwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"When a young mother's home birth ends in unfathomable tragedy, she begins a year-long odyssey of mourning that fractures relationships with loved ones in this deeply personal story of a woman learning to live alongside her loss."
