with this being a prequel, it should have narrowed down the plot to being about elise and her childhood and not about trying to piece every single movie all the other movies plot together. it made it confusing and it wasn't as scary as the previous movies. on a good note, it manages to explain elise's gift. if you're a fan of the trilogy watch it only because it explains the beginnings, i guess"", ""honestly, i figured that this movie, technically the fourth in its series, wasn't going to be all that good. series tend to have diminishing returns the further into them you wander. but this one was pretty inventive and definitely scary, as it flashes back to elise's horrible childhood and connects it rather convincingly to her present. chronologically, this fourth movie occurs after the third but before the first - it is itself a second prequel. elise the incomparable lin shaye needs to confront her past when the current owner of her childhood home needs her ghost-hunting services. with her associates tucker and specs, elise finds the place pretty much as she last saw it, when she was 16 years old. then as now, the house contains spirits. now, there are some jump scares, and of course there are those of us who are tired of them and usually anticipate them and there are those of us whose hearts skip a beat when they happen. but it's the fear of the supernatural coupled with the dread of renewed confrontation with real-life demons that really make this movie work. and even if the plot sometimes feels a little obvious, lin shaye's amazing performance should sell the movie to you. the further is still a terrifying place, and this movie and its predecessor each provide essential background for the shaye's elise and how utterly haunted she is when she visits the lambert family in the first insidious movie."", ""...and neither of them are worth watching. when i saw the 'last' in the title i inwardly started hoping that meant the studio powers that be had decided this, the fourth installment in the lamentable insidious franchise, would close out the saga of pointless, unoriginal, uninspiring horror movies. having browsed over to boxofficemojo however, and looked at last key's 167.9 worldwide cume, an improvement somewhat over its predecessor, i'm sure we haven't seen the back of them just yet. it isn't like last key is the worst of the series either, from what i can remember of it chapter 3 holds that dubious honour. the switch of focus, pioneered in the last title, to lin shaye and her compatriots 'she's psychic. and we're sidekicks.' isn't unwelcome either, bringing with them both empathy and comic relief. sadly, the other side has nothing to offer these potentially intriguing characters but boredom and wittertainement-coined quiet-quiet-bang moments, accompanied by poor monster design. the switching between time periods, and over arching mythology weighs down rather than enhances the set-up, and moments toward the end of the movie to tie this back into the larger franchise are unneccessary and add extra minutes. it's the second time darth maul popped up where he wasn't wanted in cinema last year. i had planned to follow this with the director's next effort, escape room, instead i took the time to contemplate why bad films like this need to exist, in order to allow us to contrast great things against them. so, last key i thankyou, for allowing me to enjoy hereditary more."", ""i must say the first 2 were gold that's for sure and others had pretty good elements mashed in well. an interesting view on elises's backstory furthering showing how good of an actress lin shaye is she carries everything quite well!

just jumped from scene to scene without many things being accounted for. the actors were not allowed to show their full range of emotions. if it was an 8 part mini series, it would have been great.

operator saying that hitler was under attack by the russians and not the americans when he killed himself. you can't always be the hero when evil is defeated. i don't see flag waving here."", ""this is a good film. it's a true event so i didn't expect superman or batman to show up. i just watched the film for what it was worth. some people expect too much out of a film, i don't. as for bad acting, these were the real guys not robert redford or george clooney."", ""i really don't understand the dislike for this movie. i enjoyed the back story, superimposed over the beginning of the conflict on the train. eastwood shows us how these boys lifestyles contributed to putting them in the perfect frame of mind and experiences to thwart this particular attempt at terror. i've seen people commenting on their acting abilities but honestly, i thought they did better than some people who actually call themselves actors. eastwood and these three men did a great job with an amazing story and i was very glad i took the chance on it"", ""my movie theatre-working friend and i just finished watching this movie about and starring three american heroes who had prevented a terrorist attack in a paris train a few years ago. they are alek skarlatos, anthony sadler, and spencer stone who all play themselves here. other actors play them when they first met-at a school when they were kids and played war games together. spencer gets most of the scenes since he was very gung ho about joining the air force and had some personal troubles while taking the tests along the way. compared to the professionals surrounding them-many of whom me and my friend recognized from various tv shows and other movies-they aren't really actors but when the climatic scenes come, you feel some excitement. and the reward ceremony was also touching. so on that note, i and my friend recommend the 1517 to paris."", ""i don't understand why people gave this such bad reviews, it was a good movie. i think k it's great that clint eastwood used the real guys to play themselves. they did a great job. i read reviews of people who didn't understand why they showed them as kids, it was to show why they were together. the difference between this and fiction is that the attack and take down of the terrorist is only a fee short minutes. if this was a fiction we would have seen why the terrorist attacked the people o the train, but this isn't about him. what those guys did was courageous, and i'm glad they were able to stop the attack, otherwise everyone would have died."", ""if i hadn't known clint eastwood was the director, i would have guessed some college guys in film school got their buddies together in order to take a european trip. it was all very good-hearted and i salute

first time i am thoroughly disappointed. the main event is gripping, but that does not warrant the poorly-acted, boys-go-to-europe, road-trip movie that is the first hour or so. the insights into the character's youths does not add to the story at all. these men, heroic as their actions were in real life, are not professional actors. it makes as much sense as having the sistine chapel renovated by a bunch of hockey players. i was at the point of breaking off watching this movie at many points, and the end left me totally unsatisfied and with the question of why somebody would waste an hour and a half of their life with this. now i'm wasting another 5 minutes writing this review, so you don't have to. you're welcome!"", 'all the reviews by the professionals said this was just an ok film. yet, having read the story of eastwood deciding to star the actual starsheroes i thought it might be worth seeing. also, the three soldiers who were on the train meant to be having a trip through europe for pleasure and their being in the right place at the right time was amazing. they actually were so genuine and the film managed to convey the decency as well as their bravery in an incredible moment. \nwhy this got poor reviews i do not know. maybe such heroism is not cool. but as a normally liberal older person, i so agree with francois mitterant that we should attempt to do something and not cower if possible. the three brave men were wonderful to watch in the film as well - not bad actors at all!', ""if this movie was an experiment, it mainly failed. the movie drags on and on with pointless scenes and zero dramatic build-up. the real life characters-love their bravery and courage to be sure-are not exactly gripping actors. clint should have left the acting to professional actors. this could have been so much better if the story had focused on the terrorist's path, maybe in parallel with the heroes. their life story just wasn't remarkable or interesting. the last 5 of the movie was good, but this was a long road to a small house."", 'we went to see this at the cinema without reading any reviews because all clint eastwoods movies so far have been amazin, but this

unsane,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7153766/,"['movie is good...at some times it engross you totally , and sometimes irritating..but surely there are wow moments and scenes and especially from the lead actressshe has justified her role and ofcourse this movie will give u chills and if you are physcotic movie fans...', ""while its grammatically-challenged title is just as likely to test your sanity as anything in the film itself perhaps by design, i'll add, steven soderbergh's second return from retirement seeks to 'change the game' and prove that you don't need a proper camera or fancy lighting to make a film, just an iphone, a decent script, a competent cast and crew and, most importantly, the will, time, money and passion to do it all. luckily, 'unsane 2018' has all that in spades. it could easily pass for something shot on one of those fancy cameras and actually has a tangible and, appropriately, an almost 'followed-around-with-a-camera' stalker vibe to it. it's a wonderfully frustrating, rewardingly claustrophobic and tensely insular experience that sticks you right in the slightly off-kilter head of its protagonist and does a great job of making you feel exactly the way she does at every moment. the pace is almost perfect, as we're dealt a number of blows every time we begin to get comfortable in each new situation, and the slow descent from slightly strange to straight-up sinister is a palpable and uncomfortable one. the fact that the sanity of the hero is called into question is a great move, though it isn't pushed quite as far as it perhaps could have been, and it keeps you unsure about everything you see. the nods back to classic seventies horror, including a soundtrack reminiscent of 'halloween 1978', were appreciated as well. i was constantly on the edge of my seat throughout this gripping, agitating, intriguing and generally very entertaining thriller. 810"", ""up until i saw it in theaters, i knew unsane exclusively as the movie that was shot on an iphone. i knew it was directed by steven soderbergh, who's given us such films as ocean's eleven and logan lucky. however, i knew nothing about the plot or really what kind of genre of film this was. all i knew was that it had been filmed on an iphone. while that's certainly interesting, and i was definitely curious to see how it would look on the big screen, i couldn't help but think of it exclusively as a gimmick. i sounded like unsane was saying, hey guys, we're the movie that was filmed on an iphone! be sure to check us out because that's cool!. that's not a good thing for a movie to do, so that did make me a little hesitant going into the film. however, surprisingly enough, the fact that this movie was filmed on an iphone actually enhances it, to the point where the same effect could not have been captured on a regular camera. while it does lack a bit in story, and there are some wooden performances and some cheesy dialogue, the camera work done by soderbergh himself is incredible, especially all the innovative ways he uses the iphone to shoot a completely unique-looking movie..."", ""the plot is messed up and actually thrilling. the effects when she's drugged are great, the characters are well built. i like that it's not over the top with each major occrance in the plot, like someone important low-key gets murdered but it's subtle, we know it's happened but it's like no biggie but it actually would be in reality. all round trippy and entertaining"", 'i expected this movie to be edgy and interesting it was neither. the acting was amateurish and the plot was heavy-handed. it was supposed to be psychological thriller in which we are to figure out whether or not the protagonist is insane, but instead we are driven crazy by randomness of the plot. too many characters are introduced that muddle the focus of the film, and zero get any sort of character development. not even the main character shows any sort of arc or growth. was expecting a shelter island-esque film--instead i got a movie filmed on an iphone that seems to have been written by my fourteen year old son.', ""boasting a committed ho-ho performance from claire foy, my favourite of hers after not quite connecting with her turns in breathe or first man, unsane does a functional if unspectacular job within its asylum-horror sub-genre. indeed, some of the most frightening details come from the specifics of how sawyer valentini - memorably named - ends up in her predicament, and the unspoken implication that this could be happening to many more people as we speak. confounding at least my expectations by maintaining a solid grip on reality that similar pictures often struggle to resist - this is reinforced by the cinematography. shot almost entirely on presumably specially lensed and souped up iphone 7s, you'd be hard pressed to tell versus standard digital photography, giving a utilitarian beauty. between soderbergh's work here and sean baker's tangerine, it gives a tantalising sense that any of us could pick up our phones and make a movie - though we just wouldn't have their experience, eye or creativity. or maybe i should speak for myself. one final note, joshua leonard, admirably creepy, amy irving, nicely maternal, and juno temple - 100 irritating despite a sterling track record with me killer joe, kaboom as examples to this point."", ""this was a classic hitchcock style story that plays with the audiences' trust, perceptions, and senses. the camera works to disorient and adds to character development. the sickly color palette and florescent lighting is unsettling and makes you feel as uncomfortable as the characters trapped in the various environments. if you enjoy cerebral independent understated films by auteurs, you'll love this. if you want jump scare filled cliche popcorn mainstream movies dumbed down for the masses, you won't understand why this film is so impressive.""]",Steven Soderbergh,Claire Foy,Joshua Leonard,Jay Pharoah,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYzMDYzMzA1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUzODg2NDM@._V1_.jpg,"A young woman is involuntarily committed to a mental institution, where she is confronted by her greatest fear - but is it real or a product of her delusion?",Horror Thriller

it was interesting to me how closeups were used in so many scenes. there were some rough scenes including the final ones but that was reality back then and still is in many parts of the world. i recommend this film highly for anyone looking for something deeper that offers a unique perspective on many levels. definitely worth your time whether you are into religion or not. good one.', ""as a christian, i totally recommend this movie for people who read paul's letter and know about his life with the early christians communities.\nthe screenplay was well written and was faithful to the scripture, which makes the movie a great witness to the life of paul who changed after the apparition of christ to him when he was on the way to persecute believers in the middle east."", ""this movie is far better than your typical bible or 'faith-based' movie i admittedly had some low expectations going in to see it and was very surprised by a quality film with a beautiful message. not for one second did i feel that this was preachy or 'bible-beating'... it was more pure and authentic and humanist. \nthe acting is top notch, with jim caviezel, faulkner, and olivier martinez really giving some nuanced and layered performances. nobody phoned in their roles, you could sense a level of passion and commitment to the story. the music was also excellent, a gorgeous score that was paired with some nice cinematography and production design. the movie looked good and sounded, but importantly - it felt good. \nlots of films in the devotional genre tend to end up being mere dramatic recreations of the gospels, but this one, while delivering authenticity, was not as concerned with delivering a 'live-action experience of the bible' so much as striving to express the true message of paul. that message, the one that is basically christ's sermon on the mount, is the crux of the film. this gives it an emotional heft that is quite poignant. i wasn't so moved by the characters' actions and the story in so much as what they were feeling in their hearts and what they were expressing. \ndammit this movie hit me right in the feels and i already know it will linger with me for days. that is a good sign that i just participated in some human art. \nwon't win any oscars, and sadly probably won't light up the box office but this is a fine and beautiful movie with an important and relevant message for the world today."", ""i struggled to stay awake through the first half. it's the story of luke writing the book of acts. taking place in a.d. 67 during nero's evil persecution of the christians, it does depict the gruesome treatment of the followers of jesus very graphically. \ni would have done more flashbacks on paul's life. \ni expected a better storyline and i would have put more action in n the beginning to keep the view enthralled. \nwait for the dvd."", ""in the overall cinematic universe, this movie is so boring and disjointed that it should only be viewed in extreme cases of insomnia. on top of that, they dare to call this a christian movie and that is outright disgraceful. \ni would think that if one were to set out to write a screenplay about the apostle paul, one would have the wherewithal to read at least the book of acts and if not all, then at least a good selection of paul's epistles to know his background, how he thought, and what he experienced reading romans through colossians would suffice. instead, they made up everything and occasionally had paul tell luke some random verse out of one of his epistles. no context needed - just quote something to sell it as a movie for christians. i was so bored that i started finishing these out of context quotes by saying out loud write that down. i didn't care if i bothered anyone else in the theater because there were only half a dozen of us suffering through this mess together and no one tried to silence me. they to my great amusement, at the end of the movie, paul says something out of one of his letters i can't even remember what verse it was. luke says say, that's good. so paul said write it down. he stole my line! \nbottom line, this movie is awful, it does not portray paul as he was, it is full of zero doctrine, and is a monumental waste of time. \ni love jim caviezel he is in some of my favorite movies and is a truly talented actor. i even met him at jfk airport one time because he lives in my home town and he was on his way home after person of interest was finished and we were headed home on the same flight. i loved person of interest, frequency is my go-to movie when i'm feeling down, and the passion of the christ is an annual event during lent in my family. it isn't his fault that this script was so bad and editing chopped up what may have been decent in to a jumbled mess. i look forward to seeing him in the future and will just forget this movie exists."", 'if a movie can be reverent, this is it. the violence against christians was handled well. the theatre was silent at the end, watching the credits to the end. no one wanted to get up and leave. we need more movies like this.', ""the book of acts is an amazing book in the bible and so much could have been done with this movie. it's a christian movie so i support it however it is so slow and somber. it also leaves out the fire that was paul's life. it does momentarily brush against. to me one of the best parts of acts is 238, which isn't mentioned. there were a lot more that could have really done this movie justice"", ""i expected more with descent review. i agree with another review that the movie focuses more on luke. i expected the movie to focus on the glory and miricles of paul's life. instead the movie focuses only on the suffering and is not a good represntation of the apostle paul."", ""taking the bible and making movies out of it is not a new concept. i mean we read the bible, listen to it by audio and watch by video, discuss it live and count on it to minister to us as a word from god. i do take exception however when they either read too much into a story or take too much out of one. this is called eisegesis and exegesis principals and dynamics where the reader imposes or takes away from what is presented. this movie takes liberties with these dynamics. the dialog resembles and brings to mind the bible as they use it as script. they add emotions, mood, environment, circumstances and play with it so as to tell the story but only more so. its called entertainment. ben hur, the ten commandments demilles, greatest story ever told, jesus of nazareth and the king of kings do an excellent job in using bible sources to entertain making it memorable and believable. but there is a fine line and this movie crosses over it a few times. i would rather read my bible than have it acted out in front of me but either way, if we glean the purpose of it all, we will be just fine. that purpose? truth. we are looking for and searching for the truth. wait for cable here. i don't recommend this for small children for some scenes and for dialog being complex. include this as....""]",Andrew Hyatt,Jim Caviezel,Olivier Martinez,James Faulkner,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFiOTMxNmEtYTZjNy00MDA1LTkxZmMtMjQ4MGUzNzRmZmRiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Luke risks his life to visit Paul, who is captive in a Roman prison under Nero's rule.

brother ted and his secretary mary jo, who had been drinking at a party, and were probably having an affair. seeing this movie, i can't help but think it should have been made a long time ago, as so much is revealed about what really happened. but, i still think this is an important film for my generation and younger people who tend to hero worship without uncovering the tragic flaws. it's also a dramatic eye-opener about the political machinations used to retain power. the actors are good, the story is compelling, but more time spent on ted before and after would have made it better. and i came away sad about mary jo and her family in view of her dedication to a worthy cause."", ""let's just say chappaquiddick is not the kind of movie i'm normally interested in. politics, is there anything more boring than politics? they are all corrupted and the only thing that drives them is greed and power. in chappaquiddick they show what happened with ted kennedy, the fourth brother, the only one still alive, the one who murdered a secretary. and yes i say murdered because she could have been saved. the good thing about the movie is the acting, that's good and you can't deny that. the story is what it is, the exact thing that would happen when a powerful rich person gets involved in the death of somebody, he just gets away with it and nobody cares. that's how our society works, there is a law for the rich and a law for the poor. disgusting but nothing new. all in all the movie is worth a watch but don't expect a masterpiece."", ""chappaquiddick is something that means anything to any american over the age of 55. or else this is an interesting, little-remembered but not forgotten incident from the political history of the united states back in the sixth decade of the 20th century that has interest for college students of american history or political science.\nchappaquiddick marked the practical end of the kennedy family political dynasty that was marked by the tragic assassinations of president john f. kennedy in 1963 in dallas, texas, and in 1968 that of his younger brother, the aspiring presidential candidate, robert kennedy, the former, formidable u.s. attorney general. robert kennedy enjoyed such a tremendous margin of popular support that his election as next u.s. president in november 1968 was considered a sure-thing, a shoo-in. it wasn't even considered necessary that robert kennedy even bother to campaign but campaign he did and was assassinated in the ambassador hotel in los angeles in the summer of 1968. this is one of those seminal events that u.s. historians call a change in the course of history of the nation. it led to a change of american history in the november election of republican richard nixon instead of the expected president robert kennedy. the democrat party and the democrat sympathetic national mass media, hollywood, national celebrities, et al, desperately looked to ted kennedy to carry on the kennedy tradition, romanticized as, american camelot, and become the de facto president robert kennedy that should have been. their faith and trust proved misplaced. ted kennedy was not of the right stuff his elder brothers had been, leading credence to the family rumors that ted was the family black sheep. ted kennedy avoided legal liability for breaking the law of leaving the site of an accident that he was directly involved in and also not contacting the authorities immediately after an accident. the american people were treated first hand to the reality of how family political power and wealth can cirmumvent legal justice. they would not witness something similar until the criminal trial of oj simpson almost three decades later.\nyet in the ensuing decades, ted kennedy not only avoided political oblivion but succeeded beyond all imagination of becoming one of the most powerful u.s. senators in congress. ted appeased everyone by embracing any and all liberal causes and with the kennedy family name and still formidable political power and wealth became an unbeatable u.s. senator that could never be realistically challenged by any fellow massachusetts democrat let alone any republican foolhardy enough to try. ted kennedy became above all political reproach in massachusetts as a congressional senator and only his death ended his political career once and for all. yet the incident of chappaquiddick would stain ted forever and preclude any hope of attaining the u.s. presidency, which many regarded a good thing as any u.s. president must be a man or woman with unquestionable personal courage, judgment under stress, and appropriate judgment.\nafter senator ted kennedy's death in 2010, republican scott brown successfully campaigned to take kennedy's vacated senate seat for the last two years of the late senator's term. during the abbreviated senatorial campaign, scott brown felt it necessary to lionize ted kennedy in all his campaign speeches to avoid antagonizing massachusetts voters.\nchappaquiddick the movie will prove how unnecessary it was scott brown to do so. ted kennedy was the last man to deserve it."", 'i really cant say much for the movie. but there is a very good pod cast with the sherif that showed up on the seen..what really bothers me is if you look into the whole story... if you or i would have done something like this

the chappaquidick with his lover in the passenger seat and then he left her there to die over the next few hours. was she pregnant? was it intentional? there was a fraud course a few years ago where the instructor was teaching how to tell if someone is lying in their statement to the police. there are three statements ted made, right after the crash, a few days later when he was sober, and even later with a lawyer. three pages of different lies about the same murder. the other example the instructor used was bill clinton talking to congress and the american people about monica. lies upon lies that form a web of lies. when politicians think they are above the law, it gets messy. democrats tried to stop this movie from getting made. i am glad it was. the acting is top notch, the direction is on point and the plot moves along nicely. my only wish is that they were not tough enough on ted. see this film. it is well done and seeks the truth.', ""better late than never that the true story of the chappaquidick coverup gets major attention. for the kennedys, laws and rules were always for the little people. i'm of a generation old enough to remember chappaquidick. it's good that the younger crowd gets to see how the kennedys operate. disgusting how ted, backed by his army of fixers and p.r. hacks, portrays himself and his family as victims, when he was responsible for a young girl's death. my only complaint about the movie is that it's too kind to him, leaning on the dad made me do it and the myth of kennedy family devotion to public service. as a resident of massachusetts i am ashamed that after this miscarriage of justice the voters of this state continued to re-elect this execrable miscreant. by the way it's been reported that powerful people tried to

russos nailed it.... mild spoilers follows... the main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the mad titan. thanos is not your usual villain. he is complex and multi-dimensional. he is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. he gets the most screen time than any other hero...it is as if he is the central character. its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe.

from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. the dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. the character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than

entertaining moments in the film .the trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..the first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...the thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...\nits the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene

way too much foreplay to this movie. the actual story starts with a dramatic shooting seven weeks before the riots, then switches to an overburdened mother and her cantankerous neighbour, as well a feisty homeless girl whom soon attracts the attention of two grown boys living with the mother. i felt there was more attention paid to the story of the homeless girl than the halle berry story. the problem with the movie is that this long distance of time and the parallel story lines creates a lack of focus. there is also a constant diversion to the unravelling of the times on the ever-present tv which lead to the fateful night of the riots. i appreciate the ticking time bomb intention. it all seems over-long, over-complicated and thus under-committed. if the story had just followed the mother i feel we could have had a more powerful movie. she has numerous kids, all with charm, and an action-packed story of her own. once you realise the plot you'll quickly realise that her tale has all the impact needed to bring together all the elements of horror of that fateful day and night. i also believe more attention could have been paid to the riots and looting itself. it was a cheap shot to constantly have to follow that on grainy pre-digital tv images instead of something weightier produced by hollywood itself. too often we see this in movies these days. a great movie concept, but the vision is marred by wanting to show too much in too little time. i appreciate how hard that must be, but the means to the end needs to be entertaining, and despite the quality of some of the performances here and the originality and cuteness of some of the story ideas, i felt that that very cuteness ran counter to the seriousness of the parallel story the homeless girl and was too much on the plate. something needed to go, or something needed to be handled differently. it's still a good movie for all that, and definitely an honest salute to those affected by the riots themselves, and

though it definitely didn't blow my socks off, it certainly didn't disappoint. it also helps that i am quite fond of anna faris' unique brand of comedic presence. her portrayal of overworked, under appreciated kate who spins a vengeful, yet well intentioned, situation into a mutually beneficial one was very endearing. eva longoria, as her friend, was a nice addition to the cast. i also have to praise eugenio derbez, whom i have never seen before but definitely plan on familiarizing myself with. his character leonardo is not easily forgettable and incited most of my laughs. swoosie kurtz as kate's eccentric, disillusioned mother is always a treat to see as well. long story short, if you are expecting this film to be exactly like its predecessor, your expectations are too high. here we have a crisp, modern take on the 1987 classic and it is one that should be appreciated and revered, even, especially for lifelong fans. there is humor, humiliation and in the grand scheme of things, a ton of heart that will just make you feel good. not to mention perfectly placed homages to the original including costumes and dialogue, among others and it is just as fun, if not more!

what of this broken man in particular? why does man fear their own destruction so greatly that they are willing to end their life before that destruction could take them? paul schrader's newest film may be shrouded in politics, religion, or the philosophy of love, faith, or hope, but behind the obvious horror lies the subconscious dread. not the existential dread of living in an imperfect and devastating world, but the fear of how oneself will react to the overwhelming despair of a reality with little hope."", ""one not to miss. the priest personifies the world's intense conflicts between the unstoppable forces of destruction our planet, our relationships, the consequences of the iraq war, the brutality of corporate polluters, slavery, churches more attuned to materialism than spirituality and the receding forces of gentleness, compassion, prayers. this isn't a religious movie, though profoundly spiritual. it reminded me of dostoyevsky, camus and the anguish of existing in a universe so corrupted that even the thought of bringing a child seems like a sin to his father. both ethan hawke and amanda seyfried are amazing to watch. and my admiration to paul schrader.."", ""apparently, i am the oldest person commenting on this extraordinary film to recognize that the plot, characters, and pacing can all be traced back to ingmar bergman's winterlight, yes, paul schrader has created a great new original film but we must recognize its sources and failure to do so leaves us withering. you will not have to see ingmar bergman's original to appreciate this film, but the fact that so much comes from that film makes it weird to me that no one has recognized it so far. beautifully executed, gorgeously shot and accomplished acting all contribute to the effectiveness of this film. it may seem a little shallow to some, but it is very worthwhile."", ""like the lead character in this masterpiece, many of us are tired of the uneducated, artless, soulless people of today pretending they are superior as they fail to engage with any semblance of decency with anyone who doesn't tow their line. that's what this movie is about. and how love is still able to save us. but first, we must call a spade a spade. impeach the evil trolls within our culture. and deeply shame the nation of idiots who bash movies like this because they are too stupid to know better."", ""i've been a fan of ethan hawke for 38 years, and i was sailing along with first reformed through the dramatic turn but disconnected in the last fifteen minutes when the storytelling went off the rails. the protagonist gets an idea that is certainly dramatic, but doesn't first his character or backstory. it simply makes no sense and when the screen went to black for the credits i actually thought there was a projection malfunction! the abrupt ending wasn't challenging, it was stupid and i felt used. i do not expect or want the sound of music with every film i can go with dark as long as its believable and i care. the last fifteen minutes of first reformed were neither."", 'first reformed presents a true account of modern times. the protagonist, a relatively young priest, is faced with the dilemma of either following the word of jesus or welcoming the economic benefits that being complacent with a polluting international company will bring to his church. the film is full of profound thoughts, which are very true about the aim of institutions, their core purpose and the difficulty in having a wisdom capable of balancing and believing in the coexistence of opposing values, at the same time. there is also a subtle critique about the new age or new economy philosophy of optimism and abundance, at all costs, as if belonging to such groups could provide the adept with a magic pill that relives from thinking about modern injustices and global challenges.']",Paul Schrader,Ethan Hawke,Amanda Seyfried,Cedric the Entertainer,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTRkOTUxZDItNDU0OC00ODQzLWJkMWEtYjBiODViNGMyYjhjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"A minister of a small congregation in upstate New York grapples with mounting despair brought on by tragedy, worldly concerns and a tormented past.",Drama

solo: a star wars story,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644/,"[""so i am of the generation who got to experience star wars feom the beginning. standing in a crazy ling line, literally wrapped around the local theater back in 1977 as a kid. totally unaware i was about to see a movie that would become my central interest for all my childhood, early teens and once again as an adult. and all these years later, able to share this fandom with my own son. \ni liked solo. i wouldn't say it's my favorite but it was a fun ride and it evoked the feelings that i associate with stat wars. the world and characters felt right. it showed us some cool new things about life in that world, living under the empire. the amazing cityscapes of corellia... it felt similar to me to rogue one. modern filmmaking techniques yet convincingly evoking the vibes of the classic star wars world. \nanyway, i just wanted to put in some positive review for this movie to contrast this strange wave of hate feom fans on here. i don't really understand it. i have liked something about every star wars movie there has been. some are better than others. there are weaker moments in every one to be sure. but none are worth the irrational seeming hate some people are putting out there.\nsolo is good and worth your time if you like star wars. just one fan's opinion."", ""it doesn't deserve the hate. it's actually really good. it does exactly what it's supposed to do. i think it's revolutionary for star wars,let me explain. this is a very different movie than the rest of the star wars movies. there are no lightsabers well except that one time and there is no darth vader or luke skywalker, there isn't a fight between good and evil, it's more of fight between thieves. that causes that this movie feels very different, it almost feels like this is not a star wars movie. and that's great. a great change of pace. it feels more like a cowboy space adventure, which is something the mandalorian got praised for, but that series came out after this movie, so i guess that makes it kinda revolutionary, in terms of star wars movies. this is really cool. i like it. it's better than rise of skywalker so... one thing though that l3 robot. i hated her, she comes up with the lamest jokes and serves no purpose in the story other than some weird love story????"", ""don't trust the bad reviews and definitely watch this film. it is a good story about how han solo came to be. great performances by the cast. good screenplay which keeps you hooked. and amazing cgi and visuals."", ""better than i feared it would be, solo is a different type of star wars film, which i welcome. no lightsabres, no mention of the force, and no big climactic battle. \n alden ehrenreich is passable as solo,i found myself

reservations going in 1 i had heard ticket sales were sub par. 2 i questioned the casting of the lead role we'll get to that later. i tried to keep an open mind to let the film stand on its own merit. it was a pretty solid summer sci-fi action film that had some laughs with some likeable characters that reasonably fits in the star wars mythology. the movie was predictable in the sense that it's a prequel and many points of story progression are predetermined. that being said, these points are woven into a story that flowed well that i actually had fun watching. this movie is a solid 7. my biggest reservation was and is alden ehrenreich. his depiction of han solo is not terrible but is rather dry and lacks the charm and wit of his predecessor harrison ford. we can't help but make that comparison and those are tough shoes to fill. i was admittedly jaded going in as there is a star wars fan film on youtube called han solo a smuggler's trade where the actor is the personification of a young harrison ford. he captures all the nuances and mannerisms of han solo and his depiction is on point. if there are any sequels to this prequel, maybe ehrenreich can grow into the role and own it."", 'despite being a huge fan, i had lost faith in star wars and disney after the abomination that was tlj and then the adverts for solo. the adverts do not do this film any justice. i fully expected to hate it and ended up leaving the cinema completely shook. the casting is perfect and all of the lore is spot on. no ridiculously over comedic parts like the ones in tlj please give this film a watch, you will not regret it. faith restored', ""for some reason people always compare new star wars movies to the originals and that's ridiculous. this movie was pretty much what i expected. if you're annoyed by lots of foreshadowingis that what it's called in a prequel? you'll hate this but at least you know that no one will say the title in the movie. it was nice to hear all the solo quips but they evened it out by doing things like trying to make us think lando is a danger to han. and it was lame that lando immediately mispronounces han's name. when i heard dong lover was playing

or just blinded by the desire to do something 'special'. worth the watch because it is nicely done but man those boys are stupid."", ""an awesome heist movie and not a single gunshot fired. crazy ain't it?

'american animals' is a heist film through and through, but differentiates itself from others through the methods by which its tells its story and provides connections between the characters and audience. whilst the pacing can prove problematic at times, persistence ultimately proves rewarding. should layton continue to adopt this unique approach to other genres, he may become a standout in years to come."", 'i always like true stories and after reading some of the news stories about the heist, this one held pretty close to the truth. i also wanted to see it for the local content- kentucky. never did figure out why they showed an interstate exit sign on i26 in western nc for the towns of spruce pine and burnsville....ideas? maybe i missed something- like a side trip to charlotte?\nalso got the feeling that the writers were trying to convey the consequences of these dreamsfantasies the boys were thinking about. seven years especially early twenties in a federal prison must have been hard, but at least they were not put in a maximum security facility. i didnt love the language- yes, many folks do talk like this f--- word continuously but my experience revealed its not the norm.', ""bad title, that would lead most people to assume this movie is about violence andor debauchery but there's very little of either. i might have been in the right mood but i was mesmerized and give it a 10 score. based on a true story and yet a fictional retelling. you know basically what's going to happen but never exactly how events will transpire. not one false emotion or action in this 2-hour film that treats moviegoers like adults take that superheroes and cgi!. what a relief that a story doesn't take place on either coast, nor is it elitist. and although it's in the genre of heist capers this is a totally original setup. no banks, casinos, jewelry, or even cash. the perpetrators aren't sympathetic or unsympathetic, but believable. also shows, for real, the impact on family and friends when bored young men cook up something exciting. hitchcock would love american animals!"", ""most movies that say they are based on a true story are extremely loosely based on said story. obviously, some of this story was hollywooded, but the fact that the real life characters were incorporated was definitely reason to believe that it was pretty close to what really happened. i think that this style of moviemaking, weaving a documentary into a feature film, is the future of movies that are based on real events. this film is captivating and definitely worth a watch. it won't win an oscar, but it had me zoned in from beginning to end."", 'a film about four fools trying to steal from an old lady.\ni do not know why they produced a film about these fools. a boring film and the only good thing in this movie are the posters']",Bart Layton,Evan Peters,Barry Keoghan,Blake Jenner,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE0ZGU5ZDctOTNkYy00NmY4LTlkNzAtYmFhZGNkZWYyNWFmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Four young men mistake their lives for a movie and attempt one of the most audacious heists in U.S. history.,Drama Crime Documentary

and does so successfully - but comes at the cost of logic, investment and, most importantly, scariness. instead of recontextualising the flick as one that embraces its new elements and intended reading in retrospect, it forces in nonsensical and previously unconsidered elements - via clunky exposition, no less - to frustrating, and sometimes unintentionally funny, effect. it honestly changes the entire affair for the worse, dampening the effect of all that came before it until the memory of any success all but fades. it's annoying, too, because the potential was there and i was definitely willing to put the effort in, eager to delve into the experience with an open mind and a watchful eye. i found my willingness to approach the film from an intellectual stand-point, as well as to give it the benefit of the doubt on a number of occasions, not to be rewarded, to say the least. the more i think about the picture, the less i like it. 510""]",Ari Aster,Toni Collette,Alex Wolff,Milly Shapiro,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEyZGQwODctYWJjZi00NjFmLTg3YmEtMzlhNjljOGZhMWMyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,A grieving family is haunted by tragic and disturbing occurrences.,Horror Mystery Thriller

outrageousness and the reminder that you need to live life to the fullest each and every day. at the end of the movie it's very likely you'll appreciate what you have. this movie totally made me forget of all the social bs that's going on in the world and my life and made me think about the things i have to be grateful for."", ""although it's only occasionally funny, 'tag' manages to be a constantly entertaining experience that uses its unique storyline to offer audiences a comedy that feels fresh. while the joke structure and general feel of the film is similar to the majority of comedies from recent years, the situations that the characters find themselves in in order to 'tag' each other offer something original. the majority of characters are well-realised, and all bring a different comedic aspect to the picture. the only character that i didn't like was annabelle wallis' 'rebecca crosby'. while it has nothing to do with wallis' performance, the character has no real purpose except for being the person who all the exposition is dumped on. the character is a reporter who likes the idea of what these men are doing and decides to go on their 'tagging' quest with them. throughout the film all she does is follow the characters around asking questions about their pasts, the rules and regulations of their 'tag' game, and even about events that had literally just taken place onscreen. personally, i feel like this character should not have been included in the film, as much of the 'required' exposition could have been delivered through the main characters- or perhaps a one-scene side character who was confused as to what the characters were doing although it's pretty clear due to the visuals- and not through a reporter who's role in the film is a rather unbelievable one. apart from the inclusion of that character and the exposition, the film flies along at a rapid pace, always being entertaining. it might not be a laugh-out-loud comedy that breaks the mould, but its characters and fun situations are good enough to keep you entertained for 100 minutes. 710."", ""normally, i go into movies like this skeptically. however, as the movie went on, i found myself laughing. nothing here was too overdone and the conversations between the guys reminded me of conversations i've had with my friends. it was enjoyable."", ""i agree that the story of tag is quite dumb, growing men playing tag is just dumb, but i can't deny i had a lot of fun watching this movie. ed helms has one of those nerdy funny faces that makes me laugh all the time, but i get it that not everyone can be a fan. the rest of the cast was also good, even though i'm not a big fan of hannibal buress, not as a stand-up comedian nor as an actor. but other than that i liked everything about this movie, even the stupid infantile story that is even better when you're baked. if you're easily pleased, with a good sense of humor you'll like tag. on the other hand if you're searching for a story with some depth, or if you lack of a funny bone, you should just skip this one."", 'i think a lot of people missed the idea of the movie, this is not the usual comedy where you laugh out loud,

good cast, good quality, and a great concept. it was very fun to watch, and i'm happy i did so. however, it might honestly have been better if it was more of a family-friendly movie-dialling it back to be pg-13 by adding more appropriate jokes and merely lowering the amount of profanity used so as to appeal to a wider audience. all that being said, i did like this movie, even if i couldn't have seen it with my younger siblings."", ""i knew that the film would not be great, but at least i was expecting something funny to happen and an ok plot. i thought that the premise of adults playing tag was ok if good executed, but it wasn't. there weren't a lot of jokes and the movie was relying on the high energy. the plot of the movie is also very thin, because the entire movie was talking and case scenes. for the most part i was bored and at the end i almost fell asleep . the pacing was bad and several times i i thought the movie was ending. there was a lot of filler and without it the movie would be an hour. there was a big problem with the tone. during the cases some of the injuries were treated seriously and other times the action was cartoonish and people were punched with fire extinguishers and battering rams without any injuries. the acting wasn't good as well. ed helms did a good job of playing ed helms and the wall street journalist annabelle wallis just stood around doing nothing. the characters weren't written very interesting. they were ether psychopaths or they had no development, except for the pot guy. the directing wasn't good. there was no style to it. nothing interesting or new. it was like all other bad comedies. the budget of the movie is 28 million dollars which is very high and i am not sure were the money went. if you want to see it do not pay."", ""i came in with no expectations of this movie being any good and only watched it because of an ironic inside joke between me and some friends. i was surprised at how entertaining this movie actually was!\nas with generally any comedy with an outrageous concept, tag isn't highbrow and you can't really take it seriously which is a mistake i believe a lot of the negative reviewers made here. what i loved about tag is that they took the already interesting and humorous concept of grown men playing a kid's game and just ran with it. the action in this movie was outrageous and not at all realistic, but that's just what was needed. \ntag doesn't take itself too seriously and makes the most with its initial concept, like any group of fun-loving friends would. tag is great if you're

or, rather, way of thinking - it uses to cut to the heart of its scenes and provide some incredibly raw emotional beats. even in its 'loudest' of moments, it feels marvellously gentle and is brought to life with a steady, self-assured hand. the film is extremely engaging and has an astute ability to render its core relationship with a wonderfully tender realism, examining its father and daughter duo - as well as the former's traumatic background and scarred mental-state - brilliantly and not always blatantly. this, again, plays into its pretty much perfect 'show, don't tell' mentality and allows you to piece together what's going on behind our core players' eyes. it allows for an empathetic and emotive picture that impacts you in essentially every sequence, especially those towards its devastating yet somewhat inevitable end. overall, the movie is actually highly enjoyable, and affecting, because of this emotional impact. 810"", 'i guess i should have followed my instincts and walked out of the theater when i got bored at the 20-minute mark so i could see something else. this movie takes until almost the very end to build any palpable tension. i even found myself greatly disliking one of the protagonists, which is a bad sign. overall, not only was i not engaged, i was not entertained, nor was i left to ponder any thought-provoking moments. oscar-hopeful, this is not.']",Debra Granik,Ben Foster,Thomasin McKenzie,Jeff Kober,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3OTI1MTU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg1MzkzNTM@._V1_.jpg,"A father and his seventeen-year-old daughter are living an ideal existence in a vast urban park in Portland, Oregon when a small mistake derails their lives forever.",Drama

the first purge,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6133466/,"[""this fourth installment in the fascinating, but flawed dystopian franchise, does succeed in begin exciting and never boring, but as with the prior films remains a disappointment considering the awesome and frightening premiss. however, in this film's favor, it does fill in some of the logic gaps of the previous films, answering some persistent lingering questions in this prequel of the first ever limited purge on staton island, are people really so depraved to go on killing rampages one day a year? how could the economy and crime rates improve as a result of a yearly purge? who would benefit from such an event? much is explained in this installment. the totalitarian new founding fathers need this first purge to be a success, so when the brown and poverty stricken residents of staten island don't riot and kill, they send in a blackwater type of group to make sure there are plenty of killings in hopes of turning citizens against one another. when the leader of the blackwater group is a dead ringer or ronny regan, it's not hard to guess where this film's politics lie and the filmmakers opinion of our current president and his divisive style of politics for personal enrichment at one point, the heroine refers to one of her attackers as a pussy-grabber, a pretty direct trump reference.. as with the other films, this one follows a disparate group of folks trying to survive the 12-hour purge, primarily an anti-purge activist and a community minded drug kingpin. the downside to this film is similar to the others, in that there is not a lot of character development and despite a strong film concept and story set-up, the film quickly devolves into a series of action set pieces. i found this to be the weakest of the series when it came to action and suspense, but it's likely the strongest when it comes to better fleshing out the politics and the logic behind the purge. i'm also disappointed that the series is straying pretty significantly from it's horror roots in the first film and is more and more becoming an urban action film series. the first two films did an excellent job of conveying the frightening anarchy of the purge the first film was a straight-up horror home invasion story, but subsequent films has felt more action oriented. i much preferred the uncompromising horror of the first films, which seemed to delve more into the darkness of human nature, even if the logic of the purge was less intelligible. series creator james demonaco is only the writer this time and leaves the directing duties to gerard mcmurray, who does a serviceable job, but this film felt less apocalyptic and less surreal than the prior films, somewhat to it's detriment. after having watched this film and having started watching the 10 episode tv event, i think the purge series needs to either become more political which this film did more so or more focused on simply presenting interesting scenarios and chaos which the tv show is doing more of, but i keep feeling like there's not enough of either in any of these films."", 'the characters are underdeveloped and the acting is bad, which made me indifferent whether they survived or not. there is no real suspense, only random action scenes. lastly, the scientific layer they tried to add, and the stereotypes, are just insulting to the viewer.', ""it's not a terrible film, but also not a great film. go in expecting the same as the last two films not the first film, that was a completely different type of movie"", ""it's a dreadful bore, with poor writing, and an incredibly forced depiction of the black side of this fictional movement. everything the film tries to start anew feels so out of place and none of it amounts to anything remotely interesting, while everything else feels like a forced tie in product to the other films before it, never directly addressing them, but largely relying on similar setups and situations that the other ones have already dealt with. the acting is incredibly over the top, the screenplay even more so, never knowing what it quite wants to be or wants to say. the direction is harsh, the tone and look of the film bleak, and it never decides on whether it wants to be a trip to empowerment or a social commentary, both of which the film pulls off poorly. the music is forced, the characters thin, and i can't think of many things positive about the film besides potential that the film so poorly executed. in the end, the first purge is not only a pointless sequel, but a truly lackluster film, with no agenda but to accumulate some more money for this seemingly never ending franchise.\nmy rating 2.510"", ""if you like the previous movies though anarchy was the best and the rest aren't that good,

the miseducation of cameron post,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257174/,"[""you have to take this film for what it is a low-key exploration of the experience of teenagers in a fundamentalist christian gay conversion camp. the biggest mistake a movie like this could make would be to overly vilify everything about the camp and it's staff rather then dealing with them as human beings who are the products of their own misguided religious belief systems. the second biggest mistake a film like this could make would be not to address the emotional abuse that such a practice delivers. to this end, the film lets the harm of conversion therapy be self-evident without overtly pointing to it in a reactionary, outraged fashion. this is no easy accomplishment. the film is subtle and features solid acting performances by promising young actors, led by the magnificent chloe grace moretz. they managed to portray the realistic ambivalence experienced by lgbt youth who find themselves in such situations. although it will win no great swards, will be no blockbuster, and will not become a cult classic, this film definitely belongs on your must-watch list if you care about this issue."", ""set amongst a backdrop of insidious emotional manipulation and subtle, self-hate inducing abuse, 'the miseducation of cameron post 2018' is a low-key character-drama that excels at letting itself play out in an unexaggerated, 'realistic' way. it condemns its central situation - and specifically the very real institutions and mindsets that it showcases - simply by portraying it in as honest a way as possible, thereby allowing the audience to come to their own, hopefully universal conclusions about the underhanded evil on display whether or not it's perpetrators know it to be so. however, the opportunity for social-commentary such a setting provides isn't quite as capitalised on as you might expect, since the judgement of its antagonistic characters and thought-processes very much rests on its audience's shoulders. in this way, it almost feels like it lacks the punch to properly sink into the issues on display. yet, the lack of 'hand-holding' is also appreciated and the viewer is given perhaps more agency than usual. all in all, the almost 'back-seat' approach works for the genre but it's still a double-edged sword. it also applies to the character development, too, as so much of it is internal that one could mistake it for being absent. however, our lead undertakes a distinct and impactful journey. it usually occurs behind her eyes, out of our vision, but emerges in several key yet somewhat indirect moments to make for a wholistic and believable self-discovery. it could've perhaps been given some more room to breathe, alongside a few extra scenes dedicated to inner turmoil in order to make it perhaps more tangible, but is representative of the flick's overall 'laid-back', 'closed-off' vibe. the few moments when it bursts to the fore are powerful, too. the performances are universally great and moretz is fantastic in the down-played lead role. everything's generally so subtle, though, and that makes most of the movie a rather 'floaty' affair there's only so much investment possible when everyone is so guarded and secretive. still, the overall experience is entertaining, engaging and, sometimes, somewhat upsetting seeing what these characters have to go through, which is still happening in our world right now, is tough at times. it's a picture that leaves you hopeful but actually has slight, somewhat intangible sting in the tail. there's plenty to like here, but perhaps more could've been done with the material. 610"", ""cameron is sent to straight camp after being found kissing her girlfriend in a car. i really wanted to like this movie,

off. while i understand that is a pedantic point to make, it is an important distinction as seeing repeated shouts of it's a rip off leads others to question if the writers even knew the book exists.\nthere are two fundamental issues with cameron post.\nfirstly, it starts halfway through the book and a lot of key factors are missed out. in fact, the camp was only about a third of the story. we lost her childhood, her upbringing and relationship with her grandmother after her parents died, her relationship with her aunt, her awakening through movies, and her first two same sex experiences, before we meet the infamous coley. rich story that would have added extra depth.\nit does follow the same story as cheerleader, i cannot deny that, but possibly not only in the most obvious ways of storyline and side characters in the camp. cheerleader is a campy, overly colourful, attempt to make a story about a hard subject, but failed as it kept trying to stick to the humour to drive it, possibly because it was too terrified of the backlash it might receive. didn't want to upset religious groups, didn't want to push too hard on the subject, and wanted to keep it light it case it came back they could laugh it off that it was just good fun. no harm meant.\ncameron post follows the same pitfalls. while it stays on the side of drama, it, too, tries not to push anything too far. it, too, is afraid of the potential shadow it might cast. and it, too, didn't want to upset anyone. as it was some people were upset and took trying to slam screenings. it is a shame as the material the movie is based on, had much more to offer."", ""one of the best and most relevant coming of age films you can watch right now. simple and realistic, the film perfectly captures the

one throughout the entire movie spoke english to billy the story of his struggle was told alone by his acting, it was very emotional and heart wrenching. the movie made you feel just as alone and confused billy moore was in a room full of people. and to those very few people who did speak english it made you feel the hope that billy felt for those moments. i wouldn't recommend to those who can be sensitive to the realistic elements of an extremely brutal prison and that includes gore, suicide, sexual assault, addiction to drugs, etc. every moment throughout the movie you are always wishing the best for billy hoping he can make it and not wanting to see him fail, and feeling great empathy for him. a lot of the movie can feel like it has no context and you can get confused and have many questions so that's why i think you should read about billy moores story online to answer those questions. only complaint i have is i wish they had shed some light on billy's life before his drug addiction began again and his life in thailand, but the ending was a good ending leading you to go online and search up your questions. overall very well done emotional story, good cinematography, and great acting, 910 i recommend to watch."", ""this film starts off slow but soon gets into it. joe cole is fantastic and really gets into the character. the film looses it's was at around the halfway

boxing, i get it, but still really bad presentation of muay thai, no clinch, no elbows, no knees... i can understand that you dont want to ruin actors face so il stop being ignorant. but lets forget fighting sequences, i really enjoyed this movie, prison atmosphere with all its cruelty pulls you in, although there are some tiring moments you still watch this movie without blinking. actors are well casted which really helps with perception of thai prison. a prayer before dawn don't spare you, its moody, realistic, on moments disgusting and i like it. definitely underrated movie."", ""a prayer before dawn touches upon almost every grand subject of life. love, lust, hate, deep anxiety and the willingness to survive. even though he does is with minimal dialogue, joe cole's performance is one of the greatest i've ever seen. so raw. so full of energy and all different kinds of emotions. this film was a proper hit to the gut. punt intended. bravo."", ""despite the synopsis stating that this was about a man winning his freedom through muay thai fights in prison, we don't see a glimpse of such a fight until an hour and ten minutes into this 2 hour movie. and yet, after that first fight, i was glad. though knowing that the fights in the movie were all real, as were most of the actor's bruises, they were hard to watch especially the last one due to how incompetently they were filmed. what compelled me the most was the real-life character of billy moore struggling to assimilate into the thai prison, not speaking the language and being surrounded by filth and violence. still, would've liked to have some kind of context as to why he was in thailand to begin with. storytelling and narrative wise, not a great movie. most of it felt like a documentary, given the realism of it all, but as an actual movie it seemed lacking. nonetheless a powerfully acted depiction by joe cole, and the real-life ex-cons playing inmates throughout. the extensive scenes of just thai guys shouting without translation, walking for minutes at a time without anything happening, and others where the music was unbearably droning, were torturous to sit through. at 2 hours it could've easily been 90min and still evoke despair among other powerful emotions, but even so was a laudable effort. an 8 in merit, but enjoyably a 7 for me."", ""this movie was a really good story,and just to think that this really happened to someone is an amazing thought for a westerner to wrap thier head around.the filming was really raw and made me feel uncomfortatble at times.i do feel however that the movie jumps around and doesn't really focus on the fighting like the description suggest.definitely worth a watch 610 from me."", ""the fact that this is a true story just gives me the shivers! well played by joe cole, the directing and casting, top notch. i actually thought they were real prisoners until i found out that they all were ex-cons. the acting was that good. one of the few movies i didn't want to end! very very good stuff."", 'great photography, very good direction, good editing. if you were to watch this movie without knowing it is inspired to a portion of life of someone, you could think it is a sort of visually satisfying mockumentary about thailandese prisons. joe cole does a great job, but it is not enough to save the movie from itself too tight, too monotonous, too didactic. just like the prison it portrays. cole is left alone, in isolation, trying to portray billy moore. but the writing keeps everything two-dimensional a lot of things happen during the movie,

believable love for his son and their chemistry is great. smit-mcphee as well is excellent and he really grows as a character here. they even created a language they use but even with it being non

a bit too hollywood for me and although there's a twist to the entire story i still wanted it to change it slightly, but without spoiling it it actually makes sense it's just personal preference.

say this because if you are expecting those 4 girls to absolutely obliterate a whole mob of angry people, you will be disappointed to hear that the film ends before we see that carnage, but what you do see is fulfilling enough to forgive that cliche copout, which is why i take one star away from an otherwise perfect film. if you are the type of person that thinks 4 girls talking about male

points the movie could have sped up. i think that this movie covers some very necessary topics and this movie will not rate very highly because society does not want the world to see movies like this.

fahrenheit 11/9,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8632862/,"[""first off, its so obvious that many of the reviewers haven't even seen the film. one called it liberal propaganda. the movie spends just as much time attacking democrats - including barack obama, as it does donald trump and the republican party. the reviewer that said it was dnc studios biasedly presents... again, couldn't have possibly seen it. 116 or 119. to that reviewer, the date is not in reference to upcoming elections, or even the election date of 2016. its a reference to the date they called the election in favor of trump because it was like 230am when the election was called in his favor, the date was 119 and he is comparing trump being elected as being an event as devastating for this country as the attack on 911 for those who did not get the title, hope that helps. now for the actual film. this film does start off being about the 2016 election and quickly shifts focus to the water crisis in flint, michigan, the school shooting in parkland, fl, the west virginia teachers strike and several other recent events that are relevant and responsible for the state this country is in. its not all about trump, michael moore knew better than to do that. this film is important, urgent and needs to be viewed by every american citizen, but since so many have already drank the kool-aid it would probably have no affect on them. but anyone with a brain it could spark some serious, important discussions that we need to be having."", ""for better or worse, this feels like the final thesis statement for everything moore has been trying to say for the past 15 years...though it certainly won't be. a provocateur that rides the line between downright entertaining  annoyingly self-righteous, this is maybe his best movie since bowling for columbine. not because of the trump stuff, which we're all well aware of, but the smaller, more bipartisan stuff like the flint water crisis  the tongue-in-cheek hitler segment."", ""as this is a michael moore documentary, there are probably hundreds of ratings and reviews on imdb from people on the right who didn't even bother to watch this film. just mentioning the name michael moore turns the more even-tempered republicans into frothing rabid dogs. but, as the case with his film capitalism a love story, this documentary is not just critical of trump and the republicans. the clintons both bill and hillary and barack obama do not get away unscathed--in fact, moore implies that the establishment democrats may be worse than republicans because the dems claim they care about every day americans and progressive causes like the environment and taxing the rich in order to get the votes and get elected to office, but in the end are beholden to the same corporate string pullers as republicans are. and the corporate mainstream media - cnn, abc, msnbcnbc, cbs - gets blasted as much as fox news. this documentary is not really about donald j. trump per se, but more about what has happened in this country through the last several decades to allow someone like trump to rise to power. instead of examining the corporate mainstream media demonizing movements like occupy wall street and truly progressive democrats like the squad, moore turns his attention to one pre-trump presidential era disaster - flint, mi and not only the water crisis, but the military drill authorized by obama that gave no advance warning to the citizens, and a then-current-trump presidential era disaster - the parkland mass shooting. there is so much ground to cover in a documentary that was released two years into the trump regime that moore could not cover it all violence at his rallies and charlottesville are only seen in snippets. in the end, the tone of moore's film is dire, even fatalistic. what are the answers to attempt to tilt the country towards a true democracy. moore doesn't fill in the blanks. one image in the film has a map of the u. s. made up of a hundred match sticks, and the match is lit, to burn up the entire country. if you're already pessimistic about the direction of the country, this film will give you little hope. if you're still asleep thinking that hope and positive thoughts will make everything ok, justice for january 6 is coming, biden or harris will prevail in 2024, and no one like trump could ever be elected again -

blessing of her granny. once there she finds it tough-going until meeting norman maine fredric march at a party.  we've already seen norman drunk at a theatre but here he charms esther and actually gets her into the movies before marrying her and watching his own career crumble.  march is excellent in this, and the look of the film is surprisingly modern with its lovely technicolor and gadgets i particularly like the shower in the motor home esther and norman take on honeymoon.  esther's move to become star vicki lester, oscar-winning actress, is unbelievable but as her real-life tragedy unfolds, compelling. and who can stay dry-eyed at the end?  remade with music and judy garland in 1954 very well but this first version is a jewel amongst other 30s classics."", ""is this the best version of the oft-filmed a star is born? it's certainly the best-looking take on the popular show business love story, shot in luscious 3-strip technicolor. although a star is born is certainly not profound, this tale of romance, fame and self-destruction is an entertaining one, with a loving hollywood couple at cross-purposes in their careers her popularity is on the rise while his is sinking fast in a glass of booze. directly swiftly and efficiently by william a. wellman with uncredited help from both jack conway and victor fleming, a star is born makes a direct connection with the audience based on empathy for its characters, not songs or razzle-dazzle. janet gaynor, though a very big star in the 1930s, hasn't attained the kind of present-day following that several of her contemporaries have this is likely due to the very reason she became a star attraction initially her giving, unselfish nature makes her a prime victim for heartache--and one does long for her esther blodgettvicki lester to mature on-screen. however, the set-up for gaynor's collapsible union with fading actor fredric march does eventually allow for grown-up emotions, and gaynor isn't always the noble doormat. if you can get passed the tearjerker angle which has a masochistic tone, and also permeated the remakes, this look at early hollywood is surprisingly canny and sharp, and w. howard greene's rich cinematography makes it a marvel to look at. william a. wellman and robert carson won the film's only oscar for original story, though their scenario had been lifted from 1932's what price hollywood? carson, dorothy parker and alan campbell are credited with the screenplay, though scores of others were said to have worked on it without credit. greene was given an honorary award by the academy for his color photography. this was also the first all-color film nominated for best picture.  from "", ""it took me a long time to get round to seeing this classic and perhaps my expectations were a little unrealistic but i struggled through this film. may robson plays the role of grandma admirably enough, but the beginning was unbelievably corny and the dialogue throughout the film is not particularly sophisticated apart from a retort or two from fredric march. without march, i don't think i could have made it through to the end of the film. and i'm prepared to accept that janet gaynor is a great actress but she's so underwhelming as vicki lester. judy garland might not have been a stunner but as soon as she opened her voice to sing, all was forgiven. and i think gaynor's casting makes the whole film's premise extremely difficult to believe. i remember reading more than once that this film is still one of the most accurate portrayals of hollywood at the time and it definitely touches on the cruelty of the star system which sees one actor catapulted into the stratosphere while another falls from great heights into the gutter. however, i think there's a more cynical side to this movie's message. and that was to keep feeding the audience with the mantra that anyone can make it in movies, however average your looks or talent."", ""a very touching story and should be watched by everybody.  the best part of it is you can value a person's love which is very precious and should not be wasted.  the moral of the story, don't be too enjoyed with your victory or popularity and you may forget about who you are, originally.  once you are married, try to balance it with your career and your personal life."", 'a rising young hollywood actress marries a washed-up alcoholic star in the original version of the story that was remade twice. while march is fine as usual as the actor whose boozing ruins his career, gaynor seems all wrong in the role that judy garland made her own. gaynor has neither the looks nor the charisma needed to make it believable that a movie star would fall flat for her or that the movie-going public would make her an overnight sensation. menjou heads a good supporting cast that includes veteran character actors stander and devine in early roles. the cast also includes robson, who was born thirty years before hollywood was founded!', ""this said though, the 1954 judy garland film is still a fine film with timeless songs and garland's best ever performance. both are streets ahead of the 1976 barbra streisand version where the only outstanding things are three of her songs and her singing, the rest is an example of a film with a couple of other small pluses and too many big minuses. this version from 1937 is wonderful, it is too short and it is a case of the second half is better than the first halfthough this is more an even better rather than a significantly better but there's still plenty to love. the early strip technicolor is ravishing, and the film looks just as lavish as the 1954 film with a real hollywood behind-the-scenes feel. it's beautifully scored too, you don't have those truly great songs from the 1954 which is a pity in a way but when everything is done as well as it is you don't miss them either. the screenplay has since become classic status, and with dialogue that is vibrant, witty, heart-breaking and caustic along with one of the greatest ever last lines it is very easy to see why. it is the story mainly where this scores a little over 1954very close together these two are, the pacing is more fluid, the storytelling is perhaps more sensitive and i found myself moved more, the ending is genuinely poignant. the drama is hugely compelling in the second half, aided by william a wellman's intelligent direction, the first half is not quite so much but unlike the 1976 film hardly is it a slog either. the performances are top-notch, adolphe menjou and lionel stander coming off the best in supporting roles, of the three films it's this version with the most well-fleshed-out characters in my opinion. janet gaynor is eclipsed by judy garland, but does wonderfully in her own way, her character is the kind that goes on a journeyliterally and in character and gaynor captures that youthful naivety developing into maturity very well. best of all is fredric march in one of his finest performances, a more meaty role than gaynor's but one done with great theatrical command and touching nuance. one of the best things about this film absolutely. the two do have good chemistry and you do at least believe what the two characters individually and together are going through, it's done a little better in the 1954 film but you don't get any of this at all in the one from 1976. to conclude, poignant, lavish, beautifully performed and superbly written, a great film and the best version. 910 bethany cox""]",Bradley Cooper,Bradley Cooper,Lady

first man,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213641/,"[""i saw this movie at a sneak preview, and i had high expectations given the hype, but sadly, this was no the right stuff. the problem may lie in the main character on which the movie is based, neil armstrong. he is portrayed as a colorless technocrat, who is somewhat cold to his family. the movie focuses mainly on his family relationships, and the landing on the moon is somewhat secondary, therefore the movie lacks a lot of drama. this is unfortunate since armstrong led a very charmed life as a fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. the movie covers three of his serious incidents while flying, and he had at least three more, that could have been covered in a miniseries. a miniseries would have allowed for more in-depth probing of how armstrong became the man he was. the main characters all suffer from superficial once overs. the astronauts were all household names but you wouldn't know it from this movie. the movie also had a hard time capturing just how terrifying some of the events were. apollo 13 did a far better job of recounting the terror of that flight. claire foy as the wife was ok but she also had a degree of coldness about her. the movie also glosses over the misplaced disdain military pilots had for their civilian counterparts. the complaint was that civilian pilots by virtue of their engineering training were too mechanical and not true flyers. this was not true of armstrong who got his pilots license at the age of 17. the movie should have started there. he was considered a brilliant engineer by his peers, and he was rightfully selected to be the commander of apollo 11. that brilliance is not captured on screen. by the end of his career he had flown over 200 different aircraft. he was a giant. i think the movie should have brought that out."", ""i now laugh when i reread some of the negative reviews - to summarize it made me have motion sickness so i left, didn't develop the orher characters enough, too somber and brooding, didn't cover all of the events of niel armstrongs career, etc. well, most of these individuals missed the point of the movie or don't understand this genre of storytelling. it is a first person account basically told through the eyes of the first person to walk on the moon. i found this refreshing and not your typical hollywood approach of trying to fit too much, too thinly for such an epic sweeping story that covers decades and dozen of key figures. it could have been 3-3.5 hours long. yes, it could have been a tv mini-series or two or more movies. i love that it was told through the eyes of one central figure. told through the eyes of the man that all of the accumulated effort of thousands of people and billions of dollars spent to accomplish one goal before the soviets and for humankind - having a human step foot on the moon for the first time. i cannot remember a cinematic experience that got me as close to experiencing what it was truly like to be there first hand, in the drivers seat if you will, or better put, insabely strapped into a coffin fixed atop a massive liquid fuel explosion. how any person would be brave enough to face this, be able to perform well while in the thick of it and want to do it again and again is beyond words or sanity. with death and fear all around no wonder there was a dark cloud hanging over everyone. i am sure all of us have marvelled at what has been accomplished by the nasa space missions especially apollo. the movie apollo 13 was a very good story that i thought put me as close to being an astronaut as i could get. i was wrong. so, go and see first man. go and let yourself become the astronaut. the first human that was there at the very top of a giant pyramid of people because many before had made the ultimate sacrifice to make possible one giant leap for mankind. i will never look at another manned space vehicle, past or present, or astronaut again the same way,"", 'this movie is incredible!

think it is trying to be one of their films as others have said. i'm impressed when a director can pull off an interesting story that takes place in a small setting, such as hateful eight, cloverfield lane, devil, insomnia etc. at nearly 2.5 hours, i didn't feel like the movie was too long, and there were several twists to keep it interesting. i believe all good artists are influenced by their

nail on the head, his stuff really works for me. this film started off great there were lots of great twists and turns, memorable and diverse characters, and a mysterious premise. but as the film rolled on, and the character's secrets were unveiled, i found myself growing disenfranchised with the film. goddard continuously hints at darker things happening, but he never really delivered what he promises. the movie felt like it was trying to emulate the overlapping storylines of pulp fiction, and even some of the dialogue felt like it was tarantino-esque, but goddard never quite reaches the level of snappiness tarantino infuses into his films. goddard's writing seems uneven some of the lengthy dialogue scenes are great, while others are dull, borderline boring."", ""for the most part

or just the people? jon hamm is great in the early stages and looked a bit like a young robert de niro. things really only go wrong, for me, in the last half hour. the film is certainly some fifteen minutes too long and there is simply too much time allowed for chris hemsworth to unconvincingly develop his character and similarly with lewis pullman who had been great as the hapless bellboy cum

are expecting something unexpectable, nothing happen. i was especially dissapointed with the end.\nmovie is not that bad, i gave it a solid mark, but since i had very big expectations i am a little

is most certainly not for everyone. the way the story unfolds and how information is withheldpresented is quite complex. although this may make it a bit too convoluted for some, it makes it an absolute treat for anyone willing to dig beneath the surface and get analytical. not unlike cabin in the woods drew goddard's directorial debut, bad times plays with your expectations. goddard takes painstaking care to build tension throughout a scene, only to have it all upended by a sudden twist. for that reason, i anticipate the reaction to this film will be divided, as many moviegoers simply don't like surprises or being unsure of what will happen. however, if you are a fan of goddard's previous work, it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. i also need to talk about the cast, as they deliver an absolute treasure of an ensemble performance. each person plays their part incredibly well, but cynthia erivo and chris hemsworth are the definite stand outs. hemsworth especially shines, showing us that he can do more than play a quippy norse god. this movie has so much to unpack both visually and in terms of foreshadowing that i cannot wait to see it again. if you're looking for a

be, i was fairly happy to be walking out of the cinema', ""bad times at the el royale is an incredibly captivating mystery  thriller, and completely subverts expectations within the first 10 minutes. with an all-star cast, the acting is solid from start to finish, and lewis pullman miles, the hotel manager steals the spotlight even with chris hemsworth in the mix. the structure of the film feels fresh and simulating, with non-linear storytelling and scenes from multiple perspectives, though at times, the pacing does tend to drag at certain parts. the more energetic scenes are accompanied by an incredible soundtrack, with classics from the 60's that create a warm and versed vibe. the topics of ultimatums and self reflection are presented, and exceptionally highlight by the cinematography. several scenes have the character looking through a one-way mirror, presenting a shot with what the character sees and, in the reflection, hisher reaction. there are also parts with vivid color and or contrast paired with beautiful composition that forms a stylistic vintage look. one of the film's problems is leaving open plot threads to hang, one character is believed to be promising and crucial

points unpredictable."", ""this movie should have been about 30 minutes shorter. scenes go on for way too long, the director hangs on shots that need to end, there's too much dialogue in places, etc.

winner of multiple film festival awards brings the best selling pair of memories, beautiful boy by father david sheff and tweak by son nic sheff to the big screen with heart-wrenching perfection. steve carell steps into the role of david, a father willing and available to help his son through a period he can't understand. timothy chalamet call me by your name is nic, a young boy who appears to have it all, only to be dealing with a dark hole feed by drug addicition. the beauty of this film is that the story is told from both father and son perspectives. nic writes about what was happening in his head and heart, while david writes what it was like to be a father looking in. van groningen's primary setting is a family cabin in the woods of san francisco. breathtaking in its appearance, surrounded by the forrest and a yard surely once filled with memorable family times, the interior is mysteriously gloomy and dark, warning the viewer something is wrong here. cinematography ruben impens, and the films eerie musical score, further cement the tense presented on screen, dropping the viewer into various sf locations that grab you and hold you down. be for warned the silence within this film is so powerful, that if you're eating popcorn, sipping on a beverage or your phone rings, you do any of these at your own risk. yet, however strong this film is, something is missing here. the performance are above terrific and touching, the story is current and relevant, and the mothers maura tierney er and amy ryan birman perspective is equally on point. yet, i found myself unable to fully latch on to the characters in the manner that i'm sure the writers wanted. beautiful boy is a powerful movie going experience, and one that is hard to get out of your head."", ""1. i have never cried in movies, and i cried from beginniing to end\n2. this movie really shows how distressed and powerless a parent can feel when their child is in pain. you understand that all they can do is give unconditional love and support but that they can't save their child even if they would do anything to.\n3. addiction is a monster but it does not define you, it isnt who you are.\n4. timothée and steven's performance is so real and powerful, you feel the emotions they are trying to convey. i cannot imagine this movie better done than it is now, and it really really deserves an oscar"", 'this is a journey of a son and a father trying to cultivate their relationship. when one expects, and neglects to see what is infront of him. a son who is in need of acceptance, a son that incapacitates the characteristics of a lost soul. this movie portraits the epitome of what is happening in the minds of youth in this dire generation. a masterpiece that was brought to life.', 'the father-son relationship is excellently interpreted and structures with talent a deliberately non-linear but coherent film.', ""firstly carrell and chalamet were both excellent performance wise but the finished product just felt like it missed the mark a little. at some times it felt like it wasn't hard hitting enough and rather fluffy in parts whilst also seemingly heavily waited towards the fathers viewpoint rather than the sons in comparison to the source material. the last 15-20minutes especially missed the mark for me. overall though it was still a captivating watch thanks to the two leads but it would be better with a greater viewpoint from both sides than predominantly the one and a lot more powerful also."", ""because of the nature of its story, 'beautiful boy 2018' is repetitive. it tries its best to replicate the vicious recovery-relapse cycle that most addicts go through, and initially succeeds in doing so, but it ends up overstaying its welcome by quite a long while, marching past its presumed end to noble yet detrimental effect. on the whole, the film feels very long, especially after it exceeds this natural end-point. plus, its actual ending is at odds with the near novel-length 'text ending'. i feel as though a few of the relapse periods, especially early on, should have perhaps been truncated - or, even, totally removed this way, the piece would maintain its purposefully non-conventional, almost frustrating structure without as much of its repetitive pacing. the structure itself is a little strange because the picture plays around with time in some counter-intuitive and, frankly, unnecessary ways. occasionally, these time-jumps are confusing, if not jarring, and they only serve to further distance us from the plot's events. another issue with the picture is its soundtrack, which is often played distractingly loud and feels as though it's being used as the sole emotional manipulator. the soundscape usually goes for this annoying faux-'punk' feel meant to embody a disenfranchised youth, but this seems incredibly on-the-nose and the actual song choices are sometimes strange, as well as obvious if you'll forgive the juxtaposition. the fact that the music is meant to elicit emotion more than the scenes themselves - or, at least, it overpowers the scenes themselves - is a bit of an issue, especially since the flick didn't affect me at all, despite its 'heart-wrenching' narrative. indeed, aside from its function as a realistic, anti-drug biopic, it functions mainly as a tear-jerker, so it is a bit of a problem that not a single one of my tears were ever close to being jerked and it's not like i have a heart of stone, either. you engage with the experience more with your head than your heart. it all feels rather distant, to be honest. the piece's major saving grace is its lead performances. both carell and chalamet really are great. they believably portray the relatively compelling father-son dynamic at the heart of the story, differing greatly while also having many similarities aspects of their relationship which aren't highlighted as much as i'd perhaps have liked. the other players are all good, too, and compound the flick's events as occurring in the 'real world'. the performances and this grounded vibe keep things more than watchable, even if the overall result is slightly underwhelming. this isn't a bad effort, just a somewhat hollow one. 610"", ""i waited years for this book to become a movie , then waited months for it to come out in big screen, then counted the hours until i was able to go see it........and then counted the seconds for this aweful dissapointment to be over.\nwhere to begin....first off there were so many flashbacks in the first half of the movie that i completely lost track of the story and that's even after being an avid fan of the book , i can only imagine what the normal viewer is suffering through besides for the fact that there were too many flashbacks , the flashbacks were so different in nature that it totally threw you off! there were flashbacks within flashbacks, flashbacks that only went back a few months , flashbacks that audio began before the actual flashback ......to sum up in one word ....confusing. i know a lot of ppl would berate me for giving an oscar worthy performance by steve carrol a 2 but it had nothing to do with him, the movie focuses on the wrong parts of the story l, and the viewer doesn't develop an emotional connection to nick!\nbottom line the movie isn't as good as the book  it almost never is but it could definitely be closer then this was""]",Felix van Groeningen,Steve Carell,Timothée Chalamet,Maura Tierney,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTRhNjg3NGMtMDM3Mi00ZmRmLTg0ZDMtYTBhMThiN2YxMTdjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Based on the best-selling pair of memoirs from father and son David and Nic Sheff, Beautiful Boy chronicles the heartbreaking and inspiring experience of survival, relapse and recovery in a family coping with addiction over many y...",Drama

halloween,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373883/,"['one of the only reasons this movie is hated so much is because rob zombie chose to remake it. everybody said, the movie should have never been remade, it was fine the way it was. i agree. but he was not just remaking it, rob zombie also made a back story for about a good 40 minutes and explained more about how michael went wrong. and rob zombie said he did not want this to be like john carpenters halloween. he wanted it to be his own vision of this movie as if carpenters never existed. now some things i liked about this movie was, first of all, the death scenes were great. 2nd, it actually portrayed how real teenagers act today. 3rd, this was a great plot and showed how michaels life was and how he became so evil. and third, for once in a lifetime, this michael myers actually scared me more than the halloween movies usually do. this movie has some good acting and killing scenes, and a great unexpected ending. overall, i give rob zombies halloween, a 710, or a 3.55.', 'until now, all we know about michael myers was his strange and powerful will of killing. but in this one, we witness the born of his rage, disappointments, the reason of his unlimited hate on people and the sense of being wild. so far, i was thinking that he will not stop until his last family member is finished. but when you watch it, you will find the real answer of his purpose. the story is different than the original and i think you will like, even you will ask yourself if michael is totally guilty or not. i mean, i believe that you will start to think he is not a callous killing machine. recommend you to watch it in a late time of the day.', ""one of my favourite horror remake is going to be 10 years old this year. that's crazy. i was in love with this film. i thought rob zombie done a great job reimagined a horror classic. the haters of the remake don't accept that zombie was doing putting a new spin on the 1978 john carpenter classic. zombie said he didn't want to just do the same movie because it has already been done. the soundtrack was awesome for the remake. i liked we got more of michael myers backstory. i thought malcolm mcdowell done a good job as dr samuel loomis but he can't never replace donald pleasence. he will always be loomis is my eyes and halloween fans eyes also. i do admit zombie did fuck up the loomis character in the sequel. it was the wrong approach of the character to just become a major dick. remember a remake shouldn't outshine the original it's just another retelling of the story. all the casting was great. it was great to see one of my favourite scream queens danielle harris back in a halloween movie. it was strange to see her playing the role of annie because harris was in her 30s and she was playing a 18 year old but she did pull it of though because harris is very young looking. i thought scout taylor compton done a great job as laurie strode. she was very believable and u felt sorry for her. sucks that compton hasn't went on to bigger things because i think she's a good actress in my opinion. plus she can do a great scream.""]",David Gordon Green,Jamie Lee Curtis,Judy Greer,Andi Matichak,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzOTg4MzcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY5MDE1MQ@@._V1_.jpg,"After being committed for 15 years, Michael Myers, now a grown man and still very dangerous, escapes from the mental institution and immediately returns to Haddonfield to find his baby sister, Laurie.",Horror
the hate u give,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580266/,"[""this is an incredibly topical movie that addresses some very important social and racial issues that plague the american society. my problem here is that everything in this movie is so black and white pun intended that it loses its connection with the real world and helps perpetuate some stereotypes that aren't helpful for anybody. now, i don't pretend to have the solution for these issues but i also am not sure that these kind of movies have them either. by making everything so morally easy doesn't help educate people that are faced with much more ambiguous challenges in real life and, for me, if they had made the movie more morally challenging it would make for a much more interesting and nuanced story. for example, my favorite scene in the movie is the short dialogue between starr and her uncle when he gives her the cops point of view on the whole situation, but even that scene ends with a morally easy way out. i think this story needed more of those kind of scenes, where they would explore the ambiguity of the real world, and then, even if ambiguous, build an ethical point of view to try and do the correct thing and thus spreading your message through much harder scrutiny. on a technical note i think the movie is really well made and amandla stenberg was a revelation for me, as they needed someone who could carry the movie and she does a tremendous job, conveying charisma, strength and kindness, a very large emotional range for such a young actress. all in all i do think this is a good movie, even if it's preaching to the choir, that needed a bit more grey in a whole lot of black and white."", ""first off, the book was way better. it provides way more detail than the movie did, and i feel you should read the book first, gather way more information then the movies gives, and then watch the movie.\nthis was a good movie, but i feel the editing was a little choppy and was quite basic. amandla stenberg absolutely slayed the roll though. she did an amazing job, and i haven't watched a movie with her in it that i didn't like. she's incredible.\nthe movie didn't provide as much detail as the book, as i said above, so people did get more of the black lives matter side out of the movie. you hear more from a black and a white cop in the book, so it was well done, giving two sides.\nall in all, the movie was good, but the book was way better. i highly recommend that you read the book before you watch the movie."", ""because i'm from the city of st. louis where we have our share of race issues, particularly issues that involve police, i really connected with the subject matter. it's a story worth telling, though i felt it was a bit over-written and more complex than it needed to be. but my biggest problem was that the presentation was too heavy-handed. even though this movie unbiasedly explored the perspectives of everyone involved, it left no room for the viewers to form their own opinions. we were spoon fed, and at times it had the feel of an after school special. from the writing, to the performances, to the music, everything was very literal. there was no subtext or anything to read into. maybe the filmmakers accomplished exactly what they were going for. the overall style was consistent throughout and it seemed that the artists behind this mostly hit their mark. for my money, however, i prefer an approach that is more challenging. but 6 out of 10 is still a passing grade. this is a subject that needed to be acknowledged on screen and i do feel that it was handled with respect and fairness."", ""wow. where do i start?\ni watch movie's of any type and genre if i think i will enjoy it and although surprisingly i had never heard of this film, it looked

today. this movie i feel is made to convince you to riot and break the law which is just sad. when the main character threatens another character at school she is allowed to just walk away when she should have been suspended or something. reason why hailey is the only character that makes any sense is she points out the issues within the blm movement and the double standard they have. don't

the latter is the thing that shines through, being the most enjoyable aspect and most prominent theme. still, as a whole, it sort of felt like there was something missing. i wasn't bored, but i didn't exactly care, either. 610""]",Jonah Hill,Sunny Suljic,Lucas Hedges,Na-Kel Smith,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjYwYmVjOWMtZDJmOS00N2QyLWFjMjUtYTUwN2JkMjViZTIyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Follows Stevie, a thirteen-year-old in 1990s-era Los Angeles who spends his summer navigating between his troubled home life and a group of new friends that he meets at a Motor Avenue skate shop.",Drama Comedy
wildlife,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5929754/,"[""i usually like both coming of age movies and marriage implosion movies, but, for me, the secret to those kind of movies is that you have to like the characters so that you root for the relationships to work. here i just didn't. carey mullgian's character is so hard to identify with, as she makes mistake after mistake, and jake gyllenhaal's is just not there for most of the movie that it is hard to root for the marriage to work. really liked the direction, though, good debut for paul dano, but the screenplay left me a bit flat. i still think it's a worthy watch."", ""throughout the movie you deeply get the uncomfortability of the kid that feel harmless, powerless in front of the chaos with which the events happens and the unpredictability of his parents' behavior.\nat the same time this over-the-top behavior feels also unnatural and the characters less real, less authentic and therefore it's difficult to sympathize or at least emphasize with them.\nso at the end the movie kinda works, technically it's beautiful, but it's clear that it could have been better, more evolving and that's a bit underwhelming.\nit's still a promising debut for paul dano."", ""i have so much respect for restrained filmmaking for which this movie is an example. its steady pace and tasteful design gives it authenticity, allowing you to feel like you are living the life of the main character joe. the acting is superb and the characters are living, breathing individuals filled with hopes dreams and independence. though jeanette falters at times, she is doing what is she sees is necessary for her and her son's survival. the emotion on her face, flickering like a shorted lightbulb, portrays her fragility with great depth. the score of the film is great. the story, though maybe too subdued for some, stays with you long after this earnest movie reaches its resolution."", ""i very much enjoyed watching wildlife. whether it was a directorial debut or a director's tenth film, i found it to be superb, which i suppose speaks of the talent of paul dano. did anyone else feel there is some resemblance between the actor who played joe and paul? just an aside... the film, as other reviewers have mentioned, has a restraint to it which works well and stops it from descending into overdone pathos. in its strong quiet way it brought up emotions in me which made it a compelling film to watch. i was very involved with the experience of each character. they each were realistic with very realistic concerns. i would say that perhaps the overriding emotion i felt was anger at the parents because they each gave in to their selfish needs and wants, while leaving their 14 year old son to be the mature one. what does mature mean here? it means doing what's right, as in the buddhist right action. jeanette, the mother, did things that made her feel good she gave in to her own egotistic wounds and tried to fix them, at her son's expense. likewise, jerry, the father, did too. he drank, he gave up a job out of pride, and he ultimately pursued an adventure, also rather than do what would have been more responsible, and also, more dull. joe, the son, was the one who was focused on the three of them as a family, as captured in the final shot of the film, symbolic as it was. one could say the theme of wildlife was family vs. the individual, i.e., how much can adults sacrifice of their own desires and ambitions in the name of the family unit andor the children? by extension, it can also be asked how is it possible, assuming it is, to satisfy both. ironically, the teenage joe enabled his parents to respectively pursue their own desires while he maintained the family unit. i'd wholeheartedly recommend this multi-faceted film to anyone who prefers depth to flash."", ""'wildlife 2018' is well made in every way, with its fantastic performances combining with its restrained but assured direction and solid but somewhat unremarkable script to paint a realistic portrait of a failing family seen through the slightly immature yet more world-weary than he's given credit for young lead. the piece isn't necessarily all that powerful, though, and is, sadly, pretty unmemorable, to boot. it's a bit of a strange case because i was invested in the story, characters and overall world right from the off, always involved in its twists and turns and feeling as though i was participating in its narrative in the sense that i wasn't spoon-fed everything, but i literally forgot i had even seen the feature not two hours after getting home from the cinema, only remembering after being reminded what it was i'd just watched, which doesn't bode well for its overall lasting impact. it also marks it, perhaps, as an experience more adept at setting up a confident new directorial talent than anything else, one rife with opportunity for its actors to impressively stretch their 'acting muscles' and for its plot to portray a more nuanced view of its core players than we usually see in typical 'hollywood' fare. of course, your mileage will vary depending on how much it connects with you, and i'd easily recommended giving it a watch at least once. 610."", ""as an actor, paul dano, with his long-faced gaze of inquiring gloom, has always radiated a sense of unease. that's far from the only thing he communicates he was spectacular as brian wilson in love  mercy, a performance that beautifully merged wilson's disturbance and his joy. but a kind of hushed foreboding remains the vintage dano mood, and wildlife, his directorial debut, is suffused with it."", ""..breaking.\ni felt almost guilty watching what this poor child had to endure from his so-called parents. they were two of the most narcissistic people i've ever seen.\nit breaks my heart to think of the pain this young man would take with him on his journey through life."", 'this is the sort of movie subject i enjoy, too bad beeing so unconvincing. the parents are impulsive, childish, and imature. the boy is calm, thoughful though hesitant, and unbelievably mature for his age. as if in a parallel universe where parents and children change roles.', ""i thoroughly responded to this film and felt like i'd been pulled through a knothole when it was over. everything seemed so authentic, the settings, the furniture, the streets. all the actors were perfect....my only complaint was that mulligan was very hard to hear....i felt that i missed about 60 of her dialog, but it didn't seem to matter. you knew what she was going through anyhow."", 'carey mulligan and ed oxenbould are great in this lovely drama. the music is riveting and so is the sound editing both ambient. i am quite intrigued by so many scenes very captivating! so glad wildlife is available on showtime, i would highly recommend it.', ""i saw this film last night as part of the denver film festival special presentations section. fine performances cannot save this slow-moving, depressing drama. if you want to spend nearly two hours watching the disintegration of a marriage in a miserable montana town set amidst the bland 1960's setting of baseball games on the radio and mostly empty streets of the western town where they filmed this drivel, then have at it. ed oxenbould as the son gives an interesting performance.""]",Paul Dano,Carey Mulligan,Jake Gyllenhaal,Ed Oxenbould,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTliYzZkZmItODdhZi00YTcyLTkzYzQtZWJlNjE0NTUzMGU1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,A teenage boy must deal with his mother's complicated response after his father temporarily abandons them to take a menial and dangerous job.,Drama

suspiria,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076786/,"[""suspiria has been acclaimed as director dario argento's masterpiece. and it certainly is. the plot is fairly simple. american ballet student susy banyon jessica harper travels to germany to attend an exclusive ballet school. once there, she discovers that there is more going on within than just dance instruction. although the school's directress, madame blanc joan bennett welcomes her warmly, she is unsettled by her aide, nazified teacher miss tanner alida valli, as well as several mysterious student disappearances. when her new friend sara stefania casini is the latest to vanish, susy begins her own investigation of the academy. filmed in bright, lurid technicolor, and accompanied by a thundering soundtrack by goblin, suspiria is a nightmare-come-to-life. the performances of harper, bennett and especially valli like bennett, a major star of the golden age are solid, as is the unrelentingly creepy atmosphere. also on display are two especially gruesome murders which happen near the beginning of the film. argento later said that he modeled the look of the film directly on walt disney's snow white and the seven dwarfs and, indeed the similarities are apparent. suspiria may not always make perfect sense plot wise, but it's a thrilling roller-coaster ride through what may very well be hell. suspiria ranks as one of the best italian-made horror films of all time."", ""all i ever heard was how brilliant this movie was. i was so excited when i finally got my copy in the mail and all i can say is, what a disappointment. first the positives. argento's use of bright colors and dark settings is a sort of eye candy that keeps you attentive. the murder scenes are rather gory though not too realistic looking by today's standards. the one excellent aspect of this film is the score. absolutely creepy. which argento over uses to the point of ridicule. what the film lacked the most was substance. i know its an over used term but all style and no substance, describes this film to a tee. the acting was less than mediocre to say the least. like most cult films, a minority will rave on about how great the film is but an unbiased opinion will only tell the truth. the truth is, its really nothing special."", 'what sets dario argento apart from many of his contemporaries is his success with visual imagery.  in a style where sudden visual shocks are used to thrill the audience, argento creates elaborate deaths which cannot be quickly forgotten.  the highly involved double-murder towards the beginning of the film still remains one of the most memorable scenes in horror history, standing next to the psycho shower scene in pure sensory input. and in a technique so powefully employed here and here alone, argento sets scene after scene aglow with color, using it to express the mood in ways only the subconscious can fully appreciate.  all around, this is an excellent addition to the genre of horror cinema, one of the most expressive films to ever plunge a knife into the psyche of its viewers.', ""an american girl goes to germany to a prestigious ballet boarding house, only to find out its controlled by a coven of witches. the movie has good style and atmosphere, but that's about it. there is no memorable story, and it feels disjointed and random. i don't care about any of these characters, since there is no development. the best thing about this film is the bright colors and the last 20 minutes were pretty tense and actually quite creepy. the kills are also pretty gory for the time. so yeah, suspiria has good style and atmosphere, but lacks a story and characters. the only character i will remember from this is the blind piano player and the nasty dance instructor, everyone else is forgettable. it is worth a watch just to see the creepy dance academy and all the strange colors, but that's about it."", ""the atmosphere that argento set in this film is just absolutely breathtaking. the brilliant use of striking primary colors bathing the scenes and the geometric patterns found all throughout the tanz dance academy paired with goblin's contribution to the haunting soundtrack render it as one of the most beautifully orchestrated giallo films i've seen, and subsequently, one of my favorite horror films of all time."", 'i can say suspiria might just be one of my favorite horror movies ever it delivers a smart yet easy to follow story, having many twists and turns throughout it. the characters are extremely likable and smart, and the acting from the actors is outstanding. this film is also extremely scary from the incredible score found in every scene, to the creepy visuals, to the amazing camera work and editing. overall, this film is an outstanding perfect horror film, and dario argento shows how talented of a director he truly is.', ""the movie started out so well that i thought i was in for a treat. but that soon faded away with weird interiors, illogical dance instructions, unsynchronized gore. overall it was a disjointed and detached from reality movie which failed to scare. sound and musical effects didn't help either. didn't understand the blind pianist character and his death. what's up with the italiano architecture, it's portrayal, grandiosity was unnecessary. the good part was the striking colors. that was amazing not only depicting 70s era but also can be helpful in learning lighting effects. i would have given this effort to scare a 210 had it not been the colorful scenes in it, especially red and green.""]",Luca Guadagnino,Dakota Johnson,Tilda Swinton,Mia Goth,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTQxMWUtOGE5Mi00YTUzLWFlYjktZDYwYjdmNTc5YWMxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,An American newcomer to a

'the front runner' is not about the difficulties of running for president, but more about how the media can tarnish one's livelihood, and their treatment to hart, whilst arguably justified, appears alarmingly savage when compared to trump's america and the conspiracies plaguing his presidency. as a result, the film is surprisingly relevant today, but more down to coincidence than planned. despite this, jackman's performance may be a standout in his career, serving as the lifeblood of this story - his peak dramatic moments are unmatched throughout the film. this performance may well create a contender come awards season, as he skillfully fluctuates from a good-natured family man, to a paranoid mess, and everything in-between. furthermore, the film's reluctance to take a side regarding the prevalent issues it discusses is bolstered by jackman creating a character that is not good or bad, neither morally grey, forming someone who is undoubtable real. as a result, when jackman is at his best, 'the front runner' achieves dizzying heights, serving as a relentlessly compelling character piece, however, upon his absence, which serves as a large portion of the film, it can become overly slow and laborious, leaving the audience striving for his return. furthermore, the conclusion appears anti-climactic which, unavoidable as it may be considering this is a true story, nonetheless ends with a squeak rather than a shout. the narrative aside, the film is technically well-constructed, opening with a gorgeous long-take that establishes the time and setting with efficiency, an illusion that holds up throughout. even the use of title-cards establishing locations are reminiscent of films made in the late-80's and early 90's, this attention to detail reminiscent of a director who cares for the source material. reitman is, by this point, an experienced director, and his confidence is visible here, however, it feels as though the stellar direction and performances deserve more than this generic, somewhat unfulfilling narrative can provide."", ""in an age where politics is so fiercely polarized it was refreshing to see a film about politics that opens windows and allows the viewer to consider a number of possible conclusions. i'm glad reitman didn't try to preach with this film or paint anyone as a villain. even the opinions i had already settled into over the years about hart's relationship with rice and the role of the press were softened and reconsidered after seeing this. i like that the front runner made me look at this time in history from the eyes of so many people i hadn't originally considered were affected by this event. reitman manages to keep the mood suspenseful without pushing us into hoping for any particular outcome and i think that's pretty artful.\nthis is a film i could enjoy more than once and that i might draw different conclusions from each time i saw it depending on which character spoke to me the most that day. there's a lot going on and all of it is interesting."", ""the movie tells a story of a disgraced presidential candidate gary hart, who was the front runner in 1988 but dropped out due to sexual misconduct. sounds familiar?

allow for anyone to standout apart from johnny depp, who seems to make audiences aware of the fact that he's johnny depp every once in a while.\noverall, i feel this movie will be better received when

enjoy don't discourage others ..."", ""if you know what happened back in the first film maybe it's because you seen it already. but now it's time for the second one, fantastic beasts the crimes of grindelwald. i literally went into this after seeing the first movie, where to find them, i'll be glad to see jude law playing one of my favourite characters, professor albus dumbeldore including johnny depp as gellert grindelwald. let's get on with it. gellert grindelwald is stand trial but he escapes. three months later newt scamander requests the ministry of magic lift his international travel ban. while there, he runs into former hogwarts classmate leta lestrange, his brother theseus' fiancée. the ministry will grant newt's request if he agrees to help theseus locate credence barebone, who is in paris. but he declines but professor dumbledore also asks newt to find credence. newt is visited by his friends, jacob and queenie. newt realizes that queenie enchanted jacob and came to london to circumvent the marriage ban between wizards and non-magical people. after newt lifts the enchantment, jacob refuses to marry queenie. she gets upset and leaves jacob to find tina who is searching for credence in paris. newt and jacob follow soon after. since that i'm looking forward to reviewing the third movie, there are something i have to get to the point about this movie i need to clarify. i like this movie and i still think i had a good time watching the entire trilogy in one day just like the other films of trilogies and quadrilogies i watched without a fail. although i will admit i don't find it to be as good as the first fantastic beasts come to the point of the title fantastic beasts doesn't really have a role of beasts apart from the ones that are in newt's magic world of beasts. jude law playing the young dumbledore is an unique choice for me considering that i heard that he was playing one of my favourite characters, another one on the other hand, captain hook from a movie i haven't seen, peter pan  wendy. i'm a little surprised he's a little underused as dumbledore even though we don't get to see much of him after he's in hogwarts and until the very end. johnny depp on the other hand played a good villain in it of gellert grindelwald. he is the most powerful dark wizard who caused mass violence, terror, and chaos around the world seeking to lead a new wizarding world order. and it's such a shame that... well, i'll fill you in when i get to the secrets of dumbledore. the ending climax is such a good scene. after the twist reveal scene we get to see the final battle between newt and the wizards vs. grindelwald. when grindelwald say i hate paris. the blue fire dragon came into the battle. since that i love the colour blue so much, look how beautiful and amazing the blue dragon is. it's so amazing! despite that the crimes of grindelwald is not as good as each other like i thought it would be i'd still say that this is not a bad movie by any means despite that it received hate from people, i'd still return to it and once i do i'll be sure to do so after seeing the first film again. so as it is i love johnny depp's performance in this along with jude law. fantastic beasts the crimes of grindelwald is a good movie that is a little silly and convoluted. and now with that out of the way, let's get into the secrets of dumbledore. hahaha!"", ""as both a lover of the harry potter universe and a lover of movie going, i was thoroughly disappointed, even angry with this movie. while the visuals are as magical as ever, it's clear that the filmmakers are so distracted by trying to build a franchise that they're forgetting to actually tell a good story! the chemistry between our main four heroes was diluted by so many new characters being introduced. with so many new people and also so many questions for our old heroes, there wasn't enough time for any kind of explainable character development or for the viewers to connect with anyone on the screen. the only character development with one of our main heroes felt random and out of character and we aren't given much reason or warning for this change. i was also very disappointed with the writing behind tina's character as her role was demoted from a strong willed auror and woman to merely a side kick and love interest. huge and important elements of the story were left for us only to assume what had happened when discussing the one year time jump between the two films like the jacobqueenie relationship, jacobs memory, etc.. as a whole, the film screamed money hungry and franchise building rather than letting us really connect with the characters. it also seemed as if they were only adding in twists that would surely get a reaction from viewers despite the fact that they not only discredited the original harry potter films, but just felt like unrealistic and a little too convenient! in short, as a huge fan of the harry potter universe, i was disappointed, upset and felt really let down, and as a film goer, i was confused with the plot and frustrated with the lack of character connection and development! the only reason i have given a 410 instead of a 1 is for eddie redmayne's perfect execution of the shy, socially awkward but loveable and charming newt scamander and for the alluring performance from jude law's dumbledore who leaves us wanting to know more of his history! but in the end, it was a huge disappointment as a stand-alone movie."", 'the special effects were great as was the scenery, however the movie was disjointed and did not flow. it seemed to jump from one special effect to the next and following the plot was tedious to the point of total boredom.', ""it's a shame that the most visually stunning potterverse movie was wasted on its worst story. rowling stuffs far too many characters and subplots into this film. the weird part about that is by the end, the only thing you really need to take away from this film is the big reveal. this felt like a story that got stretched out in order to accommodate 5 movies, which unfortunately is what happened. there is a quite a bit to like in this film though. newt is as endearing as he is in the first one, harry potter references are sprinkled throughout, the performances are all good, and the most impressive aspect by far is the visuals. the beasts look fantastic and the action scenes are colorful fun. i wish that rowling has taken a little more time to develop a worthy story."", 'the movie was entertaining and visually stunning. it was nice to see newt and co. again, however the two standout performances were from johnny depp and jude law as grindelwald and dumbledore. well rounded in well played. the special effects were very

the couple and an excellent supporting cast that includes octavia spencer, julie haggerty and the great margo martendale. the kids, too, are just dandy and if the comedy is at times predictably broad

very entertaining experience. for better or worse, though, it's certainly a crowd-pleaser, which means that although it's sure to give audiences a good time, it's all surface level and some of the dark, culturally important themes are brushed over in service of keeping things light and friendly. this isn't necessarily a bad thing but, had it scratched below the surface more often, it could have been a far richer, more affecting piece overall. the other thing is that the film certainly works better as a family-drama than a comedy, yet it tries to do both which sometimes isn't too successful. there are several 'funny bits' that generate from the characters and situations which work fine, but it's the forced humour the improvisational kind of jokes that anders is used to working with that don't really fit. overall though, 'instant family' is highly entertaining throughout and offers some heartwarming scenes, despite how generic and surface-level it is. 710""]",Sean Anders,Mark

it is so distracting and a travesty on history and does a disservice to the paying movie-goer by feeding into that casting diversity but wholly false representation, of historical fact. the hairdos of the 2 queens are quite silly and again, dressing all the men in black and just giving color to the queens' costumes betrays such self-conscious techniques that they are all doing these for the camera, not in the interests of historical accuracy. quite disappointing."", ""director josie rourke appears to want to tell the historical story of mary queen of scots and her cousin, queen elizabeth the first, as she would have liked it to be, shown in fashionable 21st century terms, not how it was in the 16th century. i read that josie was determined to have a mixed race cast and i ask the reader, why? the events took place at a time when not too many non white people inhabited england, let alone took their place as royal courtiers. this is clearly nonsense and i found some of the casting a distraction that spoilt an otherwise fairly decent film, other than an event at the close that brings the two women together in an unconvincing tearful meeting. i say unconvincing, not just because these two strong women would have been unlikely to act like two blubbering soap actresses but that there is no evidence that they ever met. having said that, most of the rest of the film is fairly accurate that i can see, the rivalry between mary and elizabeth, a slaughter of mary's aide, the murder of her husband and mary's ultimate beheading. these are all things that may be common knowledge to many so i'm not sure if they count as spoilers or not. soairse ronan is well cast as mary although i'm not sure she is pretty enough as mary has been described in history. the supporting actors on the whole, apart from some miscasting, are on the whole excellent, david tennant, ian hart, brendan coyle and martin compson are all strong. the real standout for me is a chilling performance by a heavily made up margot robbie as queen elizabeth who out acts everyone else in the movie. josie rourke had the opportunity to make a really good movie here but has blown it by introducing these modern woke ideas already mentioned, not just by me but by others. i'd suggest she avoids the woke nonsense if she wants her films to make a decent profit and to be remembered in the future."", 'if you want to watch a brilliantly acted and truthful adaption of this piece of history then look no further than the bbcs early 70s series elizabeth r staring glenda jackson. i would thoroughly recommend it for younger history buffs and those who like their history factually correct.', ""an earlier poster slates the film for its historical inaccuracy and then displays hisher own ignorance!\nthere is no such place as holyrood castle- its holyrood palace, or alternatively, the palace of holyrood house. the fortified buildings on top of castle rock make up edinburgh castle, which is perhaps what this contributor is laughingly alluding to. as for the lack of tartan, god save us, that's likely to be the film's only saving grace! whether monarch, nobles or commoners, people in lowland scotland did not wear tartan. and anyway, lowland scots considered those in the highlands at the time to be closer to barbarians than fellow countrymen. another contributor states entirely erroneously that elizabeth i had authority over scotland, revealing hisher failure to grasp the essential fact of their rivalry, based as it was on both being queens of two entirely separate kingdoms.\nand don't get me started on braveheart or outlander!"", ""this film could have been so much better if the writers has stuck to historical accuracy.\ni wont repeat what other reviewers have commented on the politically correct box ticking in both casting and script, that were clearly aimed at the hollywood awards committees. you can't get an oscar or a globe these days if you haven't covered the wickedness of the patriarchy, racism and gender issues to an acceptable degree for the california luvvies.\nthe other issue that bugs me is how people keep assuming that mary  elizabeth were sisters.\nthey were not, they were distant cousins. the confusion is that queen mary i of england, who was elizabeth's sister and the other daughter of henry viii is a completely different character.\neven after seeing this film many audiences have still not understood the difference.\ni've even seen tourists in westminster abbey comment on the fact that the queen mary i, buried alongside elizabeth is mary queen of scots. no no no."", ""if you want historically accurate read a history book! i'm sick of all the negative reviews about it not being accurate because it has different races playing white characters......who cares!!!!\nif you want to be entertained by some glorious acting, beautiful women and wonderful drama, then this is a great movie!\nthe actress who played mary is powerful and gentle at the same time, she is beautiful to watch."", 'movie was attempting to be pc in a nonpc time. to many inaccuracies. made elizabeth look weak.', ""this is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i'm not exaggerating. i was going to go over its myriad faults but other reviewers have already done that, so having just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this drivel, i won't waste any more time. i'm just surprised no-one in a wheelchair cropped up.""]",Josie Rourke,Saoirse Ronan,Margot Robbie,Jack Lowden,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk2ZjI2ZWMtMTg4Yy00NTZkLTk5ZjAtNDc0ZjE4YzEzZjJmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Mary Stuart's (Saoirse Ronan's) attempt to overthrow her cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie), Queen of England, finds her condemned to years of imprisonment before facing execution.",Drama History

spider-man: into the spider-verse,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/,"[""the worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. currently, film studios are all about the extended universe, seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise avengers, x-men, justice league, making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. comics have this as well, of course. however, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. spider-verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun if convoluted absurdity of extended superhero universes.\nlisten, i hear you. how could we possibly need another spider-man movie? spider-verse understands that question and has a take on it. yes, peter parker is here. in fact, there are two peter parkers. there's also a spider-woman, a noir spider-man, an anime spider-girlrobot, and a spider-pig. at the center though is miles morales, an afro-hispanic brooklyn teen who must help these other spider-people get back to their own planes of existence. he fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. being spider-man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?\nlook, i don't have any sort of hot take on

great storyteller. we experience the anxiety of his first few trips and along with everyone else in the theatre...we wait for the other shoe to drop. his showcased advanced age along with his hunched posture and shuffled walk in this film is the perfect antagonist for what is expected and asked of him. we are privy to comparisons of his choices of work over family. eastwood seems to have no regret

gran torino would have been his sawn song he actually managed to put out a baseball movie and now the mule the true story of a 90 year old man who became the mexican drug cartals best carrier. while critics have been rather skeptical towards the movie anyone who knows eastwood can relate to the movie itself, the main story here is that eastwood's character has never really been there for his family, which in turn has turned his ex wife and daughter against him. when one thinks it makes you wonder if this isn't a real play on eastwood's real life. after all the man fathered at least 8 known children from 6 different women. i won't ramble on, but, there's enough comedic moments here to level out the dramatic moments. it's a role i believe eastwood turned into a play on his actual life in some instances and if this is his swan song in acting then what a way to go."", ""dialogue seemed awkward, unbelievable, and forced. there was some character development that just sort of stopped and never picked back up. even the cinematography was awkward, following characters out of the room or watching them walk down a hallway at the end of a scene for no reason. i really enjoyed

holmes & watson,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255919/,"['i dont understand the bad reviews, this is a comedy, a silly comedy of course because will ferrel is in it, you have to come in knowing that then you will find it funny, it is silly at times but you will laugh.', 'i always thought giving birth was the most painful thing i would ever experience. i was wrong. watching 5 minutes of this movie was far more painful.', ""it's been ten years since will farrell and john c reilly starred in a movie together. their previous two outtings not only done well at the box office but are now considered to be classic. this movie must have been something many comedy fans have been waiting for... but what went wrong? i don't think i've read such bad reviews for quite sometime. luckily or some may say unluckily i went to see it before i read anything about the movie.\nhonestly, i don't think the world needs another sherlock holmes spoof, it's been done to death almost as much as spoofing james bond but i was in the mood for a comedy and this was really my only choice. comedy at the cinema isn't as easy to come by nowadays i find, so seeing these two guys in a film together again i thought.... it can't be that bad.\nmy honest opinion is... well it isn't that bad. moments made me laugh, i felt it was paced well and although not as good as their last two movies i felt their fans would get something from it.\ni do however see why people are disappointed. ferrell's portrait as holmes, i can seeing being annoying to many, it's pretty crude for a 12 certificate uk , guessing pg-13 in the us..mostly though i think is the advertising of the rest of the cast. several actors names are on the posters, they appear in the trailer but are barely in it. steve coogan has a cameo at best. fans of these actors will only come away disappointed. if they were unexpected,i think the audience would come away pleased with their appearances. like when bill murray pops up in 'zombieland' for example.\noverall it made me chuckle a fair bit, which is the point of a comedy and i can't think of many films that have done thst for me this year. most of the comedies we get are animated lately far more laughs in a pixar than in a live action movie or the odd random film like 'tag' which although a better made film than this, i dont think i laughed more. i do miss the days of looking forward to the latest movies from my favourite comic actors like steve martin, john candy, chevy chase and even adam sandler. i saw will farrell as one of the last of this breed. it would be a shame for this misfired movie to ruin his career. i think in years to come it will be seen as more favourable.\nalso i couldn't help comparing it to the peter cookdudley moore 'hound of the baskervilles' another bomb with a great cast. actually i say give that movie a go, you may realise this one isn't too bad after all.\nhollywood comedy seems in a slump at the moment, we either need to not have our expectations too high or possibly throw movies the way of new talent? maybe both.\nafter this i'm not sure this pair will get the chance to make other film together. a shame.... who knows though they may need the money and the audience get the long awaited stepbrothers 2. at least they tried something different i guess, remember the first 'police academy' was great but sequels aren't always the way forward."", ""i love the experience of going to the movies, loading up with popcorn and coca-cola and sitting in big comfy chairs. it doesn't matter if the movie is good or bad. then holmes  watson came along and changed all that.\nthis film is a mess from start to finish, if you're expecting to see another step brothers or talladega nights, you will be sorely disappointed."", ""this movie was hilarious, i don't know why it received harsh ratings. people take comedies too seriously and lack imagination. holmes and watson isnt at the level of talladega nights and step brothers but still has some great humor in it. if you are wondering if it is worth watching then the answer is yes."", 'never have i ever been so bored, disgusted, and repulsed by a movie. my family and i collectively decided to walk out about an hour in, realizing what a waste of time this film has been. there are so many better movies in theaters right now- please, please, please stay away from this hot garbage.', ""this is what happens when runaway egos have no one around to say no to them. it doesn't deserve any more words spent on it."", 'i wish i could rate this movie 010. absolute waste of time. i tried to laugh but was forcing myself in hopes that it would get better.', ""holmes  watson is easily the worst movie of the year and quite possibly competes for worst movie of all time. it's unyeildingly bad. the jokes are often recycled and every single one falls flat. the story wanders almost aimlessly and the production value is bottom of the barrel. there is seriously nothing redeeming about this movie. save your money. this is no step brothers. this is pure unadulterated trash."", 'watched the whole thing waiting for it to get funny. never did. do not recommend at all!', ""this is a terrible movie. not funny. the jokes and gags fall flat and why the trump jokes, american gun jokes, women's pay joke, and general anti-american sentiment?
