close,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9660502/,"[""2022 nziff. probably should have waited until tomorrow to do a more measured review, but watch this film for the acting masterclass from eden dambrine leo. to say so much with expressive eyes without uttering a sound excitement, beguile, love, sorrow, terrible loss - one can't look away. what a find, and congratulations to the casting director. as for the film, kudos to the director lukas dhont for such exquisite framing, sequencing, colours and sound. special mention to the flower farm hard work scenes, and the scenes following the boys at speed, whether running on a beach or through the flower farm, or on their bikes - amazing tracking. the topic of unbearable loss creating misplaced guilt is dealt with a sensitive directorial hand, and the maturity shown by a thirteen year old to navigate such a role must not go unrecognised. also need to mention gustav de waele as the best friend of leo and igor van dessel, leo's brother - both are brilliant in support, and i also loved the subtle role of leo's mother, played by léa drucker. but this is eden dambrine's film."", ""thirteen year old léo eden dambrine and his schoolfriend rémi gustav de waele are inseparable. the play together, eat together, sleep together - an ideal fraternal relationship. at school, though, their classmates start to make disparaging remarks about them, and the naturally more gregarious léo begins to shun his friend a little, then a little more... tragedy ensues after rémi doesn't show up for a school trip and the repercussions hit the young léo and sophie émilie dequenne - the mother of his friend - especially hard. on one level this film is about cruelty. not a deliberate, malevolent style of cruelty - but one of indifference, of ignorance - a bully's sort of cruelty. on another it is a story of love, loyalty - betrayal even. it is an highly emotional film with two excellent performances from the young boys conveying their respective responses to a bewildering array of suspicion and judgements being thrust their way by those who knew no better - but should have. it's about parenting, about openness and about how people deal with tragedy in their own, personal way - and it is very effective. it really does leave a lump in your throat afterwards. well worth a watch."", ""close is a story of pubescent friendship in the 21st century. two boys are inseparable. they spend their days and nights together, running, cycling, and playing video games. remi is artistic. he draws and plays the oboe. leo is athletic. he plays ice hockey. they have fun together and have frequent sleepovers. when they are put in the same class at school, their closeness is noticed by their fellow pubescent classmates, who ask them if they're a couple. and thus begins a dramatic change in the boys' friendship. this is a very sensitive film with fine naturalistic performances by a cast that makes it seem at times that we're watching a documentary. especially impressive are child actor eden dambrine as leo and emile dequenne as remi's mother. it's an odd film in that a lot of details, as far as the events are concerned, are missing. there are a lot of unanswered questions. but the emotions are vivid and extremely detailed. this is a sad yet provocative film that is well worth seeing."", ""i'll tread lightly so as to avoid spoilers. there's a marked shift partway through 'close 2022' that moves its focus away from exploring a specific form of toxic masculinity and onto a much more typical examination of grief. it essentially throws away its unique theming in favour of some far less interesting stuff. worse still, it doesn't even deal with that stuff particularly well, ultimately finishing before it can quite make its point. some of it is pretty problematic, primarily because it backgrounds a certain character and therefore seems to imply that their most important decision stems entirely from the one thing we know about them. even if this is accidental, it certainly makes the movie's handling of its heavy subject matter that much more clumsy, as does the fact that this element feels principally designed to shock and to make you feel bad for the protagonist rather than the person who it arguably impacts the most again, i'm being vague to avoid spoilers. basically, one of the core characters is rendered as nothing more than a plot device. in any case, the back half of the experience wears thin before it's over, opting to revel in its misery rather than tangibly develop its characters. of course, it does feature some subtle character work and its subtlety is kind of the point, but it doesn't go as deep as it ought to and misses several opportunities to tie everything together. there comes a point where you realise that the piece is designed to make you cry. its story is undeniably sad and there are a handful of affecting moments, but its emotionality sometimes feels forced and never quite hits home as hard as it should - even when it's at its most genuine. when it finishes, you're just left unfulfilled. perhaps that's the intended effect, but the ending doesn't feel designed to leave you in the lurch it seems to think it has tied everything together just enough to have made some sort of statement which it doesn't manage to do in a meaningful way. despite all of its problems, though, it's important to remember the film's strong first half. it achieves a marked sense of naturalism which, to be fair, carries on throughout the entire experience, both through its earthy yet colourful cinematography and its revelatory performances. the two leads turn in perhaps some of the best performances i've seen from someone in their age bracket, totally inhabiting their innocent and introverted characters while saying far more with their eyes than with their voices. the screenplay touches on genuinely intriguing themes and develops its somewhat unconventional relationships incredibly believably. it reaches a subdued level of real-life tragedy that maybe hits even harder than the arguably exaggerated, though certainly realistic, calamity that resonates throughout the back half. it really feels as though it's going to be something special, and even as it moves past its midway point it appears to be going strong. however, it starts to run out of steam and its ending inspires the retrospection which leads to the overall affair souring in your mind. the more i think about it, the less i like it. i have to give credit to its stellar opening movement and even some moments that arrive later on, but this is ultimately rather disappointing."", ""i don't know where to start and if words can express my feelings! being born a gay teenager and in an arab country that persecutes homosexuals, this movie was hurtful to me and i cried nonstop because this is true and this is what many persecuted gays feel in society, especially the eastern society, where you are afraid to reveal your inclinations only. or that you open your feelings or that one day society sees your true identity that there will be a percentage that you will be eliminated just because you are gay. i loved my classmate at school, i loved him very much, but i did not dare to reveal my love to him for fear of society and his reaction, but i knew that he had feelings for me, but i refused to confess my feelings to him. , and now i really regret not telling him because i miss him so much. it's been 4 years and i haven't seen him. i hope that one day homophobia will end in the middle east and that everyone will be free and proudly reveal their sexual orientation. the movie was great and better than what i've seen, but don't forget to put tissues next to you."", ""i know i'm going to catch hell for this and probably be accused of having ice water coursing through my veins, but, when it comes to writer-director lukas dhont's oscar-nominated second feature, i'm just not buying it. this overwrought, overhyped drama and i do mean drama explores what happens when an arguably vague schism occurs in the extremely and i do mean extremely close friendship between two teenage boys who bring wholly new meaning to the term bff. i'm supposing the ambiguity of their intimate, though supposedly platonic relationship has been deliberately incorporated here to add another level of nuanced depth to the ostensibly thin narrative, but, considering how this overlong, needlessly stretched-out story unfolds, constant watch checking is not to be unexpected, no matter how serenely beautiful the cinematography is. it's indeed disappointing to me how many other fine international film candidates were overlooked in the process of showering this offering with undeserved praise. dhont say you weren't warned."", 'i just saw this film at the sydney film festival. i enjoyed it immensely. excellent, believable, heart wrenching performances from the 2 main principal young men and the supporting cast...but, the sound in the wonderful state theatre was so loud with the cuts from each scene badly interspersed from moving, touching, tearful scenes suddenly loudly sportingschoolyard etc ones blasted into the screen...like a sledgehammer. needs an edit.']",Vicky Jewson,Noomi Rapace,Sophie Nélisse,Indira Varma,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg4NmE0NzctMjBkMC00YjQyLWFjZDktNDBkMjU5ZGFlZDU3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"The intense friendship between two thirteen-year old boys Leo and Remi suddenly gets disrupted.

doesn't mean that it's without its merits, though. it may occupy a well-worn genre but it occupies it well, comfortably conforming to - and occasionally contorting - the conventions it knows so keenly. it also has a good amount of edge, self-censoring only through its central conceits, and, as such, it feels much closer to the fondly-remembered 'kid' films of yesteryear than most of the stuff being pumped out today and not just because it's live-action. this actually makes it feel incredibly authentic as each moment seems to serve the story. whether it's scary, funny, heartfelt or just plain action-packed, the flick always makes a point of staying true to itself, having an excellent understanding of its target audience in the process. of course, this means that much of the piece is painted in pretty broad strokes. the humour is never really successful and the character-work is all incredibly basic. still, it's appreciated. by the time the finale rolls around, you'll be invested in the characters and will actively want to see them succeed. speaking of the finale, it's probably the best part it's exciting, well-staged and uniquely large-scale. unfortunately, it's preceded by a pace-killing 'fake-out' that's not only obvious but also just far too long. without it, i feel the picture would have moved much more smoothly into its final movement and, generally, been all the more successful. it doesn't destroy the experience, though. overall, the movie is a fun and well-executed entry into a widely-seen genre. it's, essentially, as predictable as it is enjoyable. it's not groundbreaking, nor extremely engaging, but it's entertaining enough to be worth a watch, especially - i suppose - if you aren't as familiar with its framework as i am. 610"", 'i saw the trailer to this film prior to the disappointment that was aquaman and it seemed so formulaic - arthurian legend being overlayed onto british schoolchildren with whatever attitudes. however, my son asked me to take him and a friend so i duly obliged, expecting the worst...i was disappointed to be proven wrong. this is a wonderful family film about friendship, honour and strength in unity  just what this country needs amidst the debacle of brexit and i recommend all adults take their children to watch it.', 'opening is good, but after one hours, it decent. i really hope epic battle, but, is not really, is decent. but overall, if i can compare, this story is like trollhunters tales of arcadia. i think, this movie have potential on animation, who people can really understand about fairy tale. but overall good, even this movie is failed on commercial.', 'the classic king arthur story has a modern take with a good number of comical and clever moments, but also a few moments that will make you cringe, and overall, it does go on for too long. the acting quality varies significantly between the small cast of characters, but the special effects are good and the morals it promotes are sensible.', ""perfect movie for any nerd who likes adventure and comedy. great to sit and watch with a slushee and some popcorn. the plot never got slow or boring i was entertained the entire time. i loved the nerdy references and jokes as well as the political commentary. i wouldn't recommend bringing children under 8 or so, this movie is definitely more targeted towards adults and teens."", ""some of the worst acting ever seen, it's more like a middle school production than a professional film. louis serkis has obviously inherited his dad's talent as he is the only one to give a convincing performance."", ""the arthurian legends were the ya novels of their day. full of magic, humanism, drama, and adventure, they carry the epic traits of so many of the modern tales we get wrapped up in. now those tales have returned, boasting the influences of so many of the stories it helped to birth harry potter, star wars the oafishly wise mentor, the unassuming hero, the otherworldly foes, the good-hearted sidekicks. it's a plot as old as time and as predictable as any old fable, but with strong characters and cool lore, the kid who would be king manages to be forgettable, childish fun.\nwhen young alex finds and removes a sword from a cinder block, it becomes clear that he may be the descendant of king arthur himself. joined by a team of outcast schoolmates, they go on an amblin-esque quest, including the action ingenuity and lovable loser protagonists of beloved films like goonies. on the same note, it also includes the obnoxious tendencies of those 80s films that parents squint their eyes at constant yelling, demonizing of adults. luckily, director cornish displays a care rarely seen in modern live-action kids fare, as proved by big themes like modern politics and little details like dirty fingernails.\nultimately though, this is a silly little movie, which isn't a bad thing. the hero's-journey opening and the final battle are a blast, combining the best elements of home alone, hook, and even lord of the rings, and its calling card in those moments is its over-the-top-ness. do i wish it was maybe either more substantive or more overtly juvenile? sure. but my 6-year-old was fully engrossed throughout, so what do i know?"", ""how this movie has had so many positive reviews is baffling to me. it is absolutely bloody dreadful. the acting is appalling and the writing is like something from the pen of a talentless first year media studies student. utter garbage and literally one of the worst films i've ever seen. i know taste is a subjective thing but if you enjoyed this you must be very easily impressed!!"", ""last school year, i was on a school field trip to the mall to watch this movie. before coming into this movie, i was predicting this movie would be spectacular and entertaining. that was before i went inside the theatres. when i watched the actual movie, it was really disappointing. some parts were

all in or all out euthanasic, and the pursuit of who she is.\nstorywise, the film ingeniously weaved the first 11 books of manga together, brought up few events that was happening in the 2nd chapter of alita's adventure to the 1st movie. which is nice since i bet they're already thinking of the next alita movie. but as few of cameron's work, the dark side and the ugliness of irontown wasn't rendered enough. the lack of depth on the ugliness made the whole plot a bit light, the emotional conflict wasn't intense enough and the romance plotline which is very important in the 1st chapter a

his depth as a bit part character in a teen soap opera. the story revolves around her saving him continually while the audience is all hoping he dies. it's bad, i've no idea what the writers were

out who she truly is. she finds herself in a world where she can be seen as somewhat ordinary. but she comes to find out that she's far from ordinary. she's an angel from heaven. i really enjoyed this

must agree. i saw both. there wasn't much of a climax so it slightly fizzled at the end but it really left it open for sequels which is what they were obviously going for. i hate to say this, because

imaginary animated characters in wonder park seem to distance the audience from becoming more directly involved in the movie. in last action hero 1993 a fun superhero action movie has a real boy

connection to its characters by its very nature sustained in the movie while also introducing a continuing series of action scenes throughout the movie. my girlfriend's boyfriend 2010 is an amazing example of a funny romantic comedy based on the interaction of writing and how it can become real. even christopher robin 2018 has a fanciful charm where storybook characters can interact well with

protagonists in laika's previous works. the actual story itself is very simple and quite generic, but luckily the globe-trotting adventure includes several locations and scenarios for the characters to be in, which are all entertaining. the relationship between frost and mr. link leads to some entertaining interactions, and the situations they find themselves in are all fairly humorous, too. so, while it's not all that original and there aren't really any arcs, it is entertaining throughout. surprisingly, the action sequences are well done and actually quite thrilling, while still retaining the fun 'adventure feel'. it's also, like the rest of laika's works, not afraid of pulling its punches and is more mature than the average animated feature. overall, it's arguably the worst film that laika has produced thus far, but it is still very entertaining and has great animation. 710"", ""this is a small film that not many audiences were aware of. i became aware of this via hugh jackman's instagram. other than that, i had never heard of it. then suddenly it was out in cinemas. the reason i went and saw it was because it was the only film in the cinema, at that time, i hadn't seen. my wallet has become aware of this. i'm glad that i went and saw this because it has been one of the better films of the year so far.\npositives!\nall the actors involved with the project do a terrific job. jackman is fantastic, saldana is just as awesome as ever, and galifianakis was a perfect choice to voice the lovable sasquatch. there is a tonne of great humour for both children and adult audiences to understand and applaud. chris butler does an incredible job directing this stop motion animation. getting these well-received lively performances but also great animated work. the film is edited together to create a classic adventure film and it keeps you very well involved. the animation itself was fantastic. it was an awesome throwback to the classic animated films with its tone and ambiance. the character design was amusing but not off-putting. but there is also awesome artwork in the background. there is some good sound design that's not just a repeated soundboard. an entertaining score from carter burwell and some amusing original music.\nmixed!\nthe plot and writing are familiar and that makes it predictable. where the story goes and the character arcs are foreseeable but the fact that they are entertaining and have a lot of charm, it's easy to overlook those aspects!\nconclusion!\nso, missing link is vastly enjoyable, and i'll recommend it to anyone that enjoys an entertaining animated movie but also to any fans of stop motion. all the cast are great in those roles, especially galifianakis as the endearing title character. there is some great humour in the script for all audiences to enjoy but also some hilarious physical humour. my favourite sequence is on the boat when our characters are on the run from one of the antagonists and the boat is on the harsh seas. if you were a fan of kubo and the two strings, this is from the same studio. but this film has a touch of familiarity in its script and that makes it predictable."", ""laika's latest outing, for better or worse, carries with it a certain expectation of quality, thanks to their previously pretty much entirely untarnished record. of course, 'missing link 2019' really shouldn't be judged solely against its ancestors, as that's simply not fair even if it's, essentially, inevitable and, even, somewhat understandable. it initially seems like a bit of a departure for the studio, perhaps spurred on by their new annapurna pictures partnership. however, you soon come to realise that it takes a similar approach when it comes to its story-telling family-friendly but fairly uncompromising. there's a good amount of action here and it all feels suitably tangible. as usual, it comes with consequences, too. these stakes help drive the adventure, which is always quite propulsive and pacy. it also takes some unexpected - or, maybe, risky - turns and has a decent thematic underpinning. in general, though, it seems to lack a sense of urgency - even though, by all rights, it shouldn't - and the characters are a tad flat. around halfway through, the lead seems to regress into a slightly more selfish state so that the flick can manufacture some conflict. it feels as though the writers realised that the hero needed to undergo the arc that he ultimately does but didn't go back through the piece to refine what they'd already written. it doesn't help that the arc itself is quite basic and, almost, expected. it's also strange that the protagonist only changes whenever he's told to by the female lead. the film is probably trying to imply that he's undergone some internal reflection after their confrontations but, instead, it seems more like he's doing his subsequent good deeds simply to 'get the girl' and further his own agenda. it's perhaps a small thing but it's something that i noticed. on the whole, though, these small character issues don't detract from an undeniably beautiful picture. laika continue to hone their stop-motion craft with each movie they produce. the facial animation, especially, looks superb. on top of that, it's consistently entertaining. while it isn't as emotionally engaging as it could have been, it's a solid story that will keep you watching until the end. 710"", ""the film does not get overly 'deep' but it is a fun little adventure. the impressive part is the animation, but the story feels a little too large with inconsistent pacing. i would say the movie is worth watching once, but is not one you need to come back to."", ""missing link 2019 is a movie my daughter and i caught in theatres shortly after it was released. the storyline follows an unsuccessful world explorer due to his lack of recognition by his peers well, recognition comes to him when the missing link discovers the explorer and asks him to help him find his origins. this mutually beneficial relationship sounds to be too perfect to be true...probably because it is. this movie is directed by chris butler paranorman and contains the voices of hugh jackman x-men, zach galifianakis the hangover, zoe saldana guardians of the galaxy, timothy olyphant the crazies and emma thompson remains of the day. the animation of this film was so fun and unique, like an animated claymation series. the storyline was worth following, entertaining but not overly compelling. i wasn't invested in the characters and what happened to them. the comedic content definitely has some moments where you crack up but again, was inconsistent and just okay. as an overall movie this is a fun family pick that is worth watching with your child once however, it falls short of its potential and isn't a must have for your collection. i'd score this a 6.510."", ""i've seen mixed reviews, but i absolutely loved it. beautiful animation, lovable characters, droll verbal humor, and hilarious visual humor. i would have happily sat through a second screening immediately after the first."", ""this film looks amazing. the animation is highly detailed and just beautiful most of the time. unfortunately, every other aspect of the film isn't great. if you love animation, give this one a watch."", ""actually i like stop motion films, but this one didn't catch me. missing link is plagued by over-simplified caricatures of protagonists and even worse antagonists. the lack of depth reaches into its comedy too, with a joke repertoire that seems to restate itself over and over again. the first act introduced some interesting characters and had some funny moments, but by the end i was fairly disappointed because there was no growth from there. the impressive stop-motion animation was brilliant, but the combination with cgi destroyed the specific charme of handmade stopmotion.""]",Chris Butler,Hugh

because video game movies are something that historically were a wait til it's on tv type of thing - no real reason to see them on the big screen they weren't much different than the games they came from.\ndetective pikachu, on the other hand, is an actual movie. yes, it's set in a world where pokémon actually exist, and this one can talk to both humans and pokémon doctor doolittle, anyone?, but unlike a video game movie, the plot isn't just a vehicle for the setting. it's an actual mysteryadventure, with characters you come to care about, both human and not. twists and surprises and feels. all the parts of a great flick.\none thing that surprised me was how i was amazed by the emotions expressed by the pikachu character - not only did he feel real in the movie, his face, ears, body language conveyed emotion clearly and strongly. it's hard to explain, it was kind of like a cross between looking at a child and a puppy... i don't know how they did it, but when pikachu was saddened, you felt it when happy, you knew it...\nfinally, i also do have to say that all of us were concerned about the deadpool factor - which turned out to be a non-issue. ryan reynolds is a great actor, and like any great actor, you only see and hear the character he's playing - not his past ones.\nexcellent movie for all ages, even if you're not a pokémon fan, you'll enjoy it."", ""theater impressions--short review semi-casual pokémon fan here--played through a few of the games never played detective pikachu, watched the anime as a kid, but not super invested in the franchise. a lot of people seem to be giving this movie high ratings. detective pikachu is not without merit, but the film's good points namely, ryan reynold's performance, some good humor, some nice character interaction and overall high production values are unfortunately outweighed by its bad points namely, a needlessly and hopelessly convoluted plot, hit-or-miss performances from the remaining cast, some jokes that didn't land, some heavy-handed dialogue and some poor character interaction, and lack-luster cgi. the film is overall inconsistent in tone it doesn't seem to really know who it's for or what it wants to be. i had fun watching the film with my friends in the theater who are also familiar with pokémon, but if you're unfamiliar with pokémon or if you're watching it on your own on the small screen it might not quite be an enjoyable experience."", ""as much as i am a pokemon fan, this movie kind of sucked. i mean i didn't expect much seeing the plot similar to any other pokemon animated movies, but the plot was a bit extra boring. i guess the only upside is the pokemon looked kind of cute?

life was boring, far from it. you just have this overwhelming desire to be watching the fantasies inside his head that pepper the movie more than the biopic that is this film. it does however paint a

the professor,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6865690/,"[""be yourself. be true to yourself. don't settle for what you are not. quotes from this movie resonated with me. my mind has been wandering on lines like why do we float through this weird thing called life without living?. live life and don't simply exist. like the professor says you got one shot at this. don't let a moment of it slip by. a genuine performance by johnny depp and the whole cast. i enjoyed the writing. with the emphasis on observations and the thoughts of the mundane, relationships and the honesty of people. it also includes the best acting i've seen from danny huston. i full heartedly bought his friendship with depp's character. the story starts with a slightly quirkier tone, but gets more and more real as you get to the second half. depp plays the broken man and you can see that pain and regret in his eyes. a very human story that eventually tugged at my heartstrings. some scenes could have been handled differently during the first half. but the deep thoughts and confessions presented later was able to bring it all home. i do feel better for having been on this little journey of a man and his emotional bender. it's very unfiltered, so it's definitely not for too young minds. you gotta be somewhat ready the face hardships of existence. while not perfect, the director and the whole crew still made one thing very clear that this one was from the heart."", ""johnny depp is the best thing about this melo-drama. i would not call it a comedy, nor a drama. the script is ok but the story seems a bit blah. good premise but could have been so much better. however, johnny depp shines. can't help but fall in love with his character."", 'as a drama lover , this is the first time that i see

be a genuinely earnest  moderately profound attempt at processing the various emotions  reconciling the various relationships as we near the bitter end of our present mortality. to his credit depp manages to humorously navigate these mine fields without allowing things to get too far over the top as he has so often in his recent endeavors. certainly, there's allot more to it than can be covered in a feature length dramedy film.. never the less it does seems to offer at least some modest insights into how one might or might not want to go about it all."", 'the drunken hero is obnoxious and

were your last is portrayed here in spades, so it is nothing new. we all know the drill facing death, we change our perceptions and reactions to life and live it to the fullest until we kick the bucket. this has been done dozens of times before in dozens of movies. depp is an adequate actor, but nothing special and the story is not that original it has been done dozens of times before in tv and film. spend your time and money elsewhere.', 'johnny depp is the life of this film. he just potrait his character as the oxygen here. in some scene, his dialogues were very much moving and his funny sides were in there too. the story is very good from the start and shows the end the way we could like. this film urges to have the essence of life and to enjoy it to the every last detail. i liked the way johnny showed the view of his entire life, which we most have. it is not an intellectuals kind of film, its a funny view of a normal life which most people have.', ""i don't know if this was a brilliantly emotional film or whether it just hit me hard but i loved the monologues from johnny depps character richard, who realises how precious time is once he is given just months to live after a positive cancer diagnosis. it really does a good job of making you connect with the character and although not done quite as well, it definitely gives off dead poet society vibes with richards unorthodox teaching methods and how he connects and interacts with his students."", ""i have to admit i was reluctant to watch this movie because i have a relative going through the last stages of a terminal cancer, so the synopsis didn't appeal to me at first. however, since i'm a fan of independent movies and the trailer seemed interesting enough, i decided to give it a go. i laughed, i cried, and i had an overall good time. the movie has its many silly moments, but it also has a strong emotional load that is, in my opinion, even better than the comedy. i enjoyed seeing depp in a role a little more serious than his latest movies, without weird make up on his face. he gives a truly good performance that is a clear reminder that underneath his eccentric appearance, he is an amazing actor black mass being the most recent example of this. his character, i feel, is not purposely made as unlikeable and loathsome, but you can't help but feel sorry for him and by the end of the movie his many seemingly annoying traits become his most endearing qualities. as for the supporting cast, i particularly enjoyed zoey deutch as claire and danny huston as peter even though they're relegated to a secondary place, they live up to their roles and deliver good performances. the cinematography and various locations were beautiful. a heads up, though the movie can be hard to watch at points because of his illness- it did heighten the emotional load for me. and there's a lot of swearing, drinking and sexual situations, so kids should probably skip it."", ""this is the sort of movie the majority hates because it makes you think, which a lot of people hate to do. it makes you confront mortality, which we all must do one day, and decide how you are going to live the days you have left. in a way, it's a horror movie because the thought of dying is the scariest thing to confront, but depp plays it real and heartfelt. he embraces life and is not crying about his plight. it's a brave movie and he takes it and owns it. this is not a sob story, it's an adult movie for those who think and feel. not morose, it's full of life, and sad only when he realizes the sands of time are draining away."", ""to all of you cancer victims and survivors, i can't even begin to know or think how i would react to receiving a report like depp received from his doctor, in this film. but i will always have a great level of respect for your courage endurance and will to live, because your community is not a place anyone wants to voluntarily be apart of, but you know how to come together in full support for each other against all odds, my hats stays off for you all. one another note, this film brought tears to my eyes, and depp played and excellent role as a cancer victim, and in the end after watching it, you just want to thank god for being alive. i enjoyed this film very much."", ""lovely movie. johnny depp shines. it's charming, heart-breaking and funny. it's nice to see a movie

point with no return. if there's one thing death could teach us, it must be life. to live, like your true soul requests, not surviving but being alive. to die, like there's no compromise, not avoiding but accepting."", ""f...! f...! f...! how is it possible to be depp and make such a sentimental superficial movie? the irony in watching the movie the message is do not waste your life, live to the

ice, i love you scenes etc. richard's best friend gets the best acting, and a more coherent character. f...! a mediocre scenario that tries to project a deep story for depp, unsuccessfully. as said in

although, the viewing experience is always active. it struggles to provoke a deep connection because we aren't really allowed to get close to anyone. still, the affair is usually engaging. it isn't a masterpiece but it's always well-crafted and often enjoyable. it's a rather complex look at a complex relationship, subtly painting its characters in eventually fairly vivid colours. however, it does start to wear thin after a while, with a slow pacing that sees it drag towards its end. there also isn't a huge sense of escalation, even if the flick ends exactly when it should. it's a definitive narrative so the fact that it's apparently getting a sequel is rather strange. i'd still watch it, though. 610"", ""in my humble opinion, the devil is not so black as he is painted, i.e. those numerous 110 reviews on here. if you can relate to toxic relationships or been in one, you will appreciate that aspect of the movie, how painfully accurately it's been conveyed."", ""with no apparent story, un-empathetic characters, bland disconnected sets, no arc and no reveal, this film about a person trying to make a film fails at all the important touch points. there may be some hidden autobiographical theme here but it is so hidden as to be buried, immersed in film lingo and presuppositions about the viewers' experience that we are constantly attempting to find our footing through a murky, slippery fog. skip this one."", ""the story goes deeper and deeper every scene with a great structure. tranquility of the movie tells more about characters and how to perceive the world of the movie. it is like fragment of memories from the past which gives the character one of the biggest emotional pain of her life so it is basically a coming-of-age story. there is much to tell but you should watch it. i did not realize the movie was that much good until the end then i couldn't stop thinking the movie for a long time."", 'i found the souvenir to be a brutally honest protrayal of a toxic relationship. it depicts the rolls both partners play in the development of an addictive process. it is beautifully acted and intelligently directed. it is well worth seeing.', ""i had high hopes based on capsule reviews i read, but this is an awful film. why should anyone care about a self-destructive junkie who has had every advantage in his life and a fool who is a hopelessly romantic enabler? the one redeeming feature is that the cinematography is good. but it doesn't help the story. i assume it is somewhat autobiographical. how sad. it is absolutely dreadful!""]",Joanna Hogg,Honor Swinton Byrne,Tom Burke,Tilda Swinton,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NjY3NDYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTUxNzg0NzM@._V1_.jpg,A young film student in the early '80s becomes romantically involved with a complicated and untrustworthy man.,Romance Drama

annabelle comes home,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8350360/,"[""the first thing you'll probably notice is just how much better 'annabelle comes home 2019' is, immediately, than 'the nun 2018', 'the curse of la llorona 2019' and its oft-forgotten predecessor, 'annabelle 2014'. i mean, it seems like a masterpiece in comparison to those it's actually engaging, features a variety of successful scares and centres around compelling characters. however, the second thing you'll probably notice is just how much worse it is than 'the conjuring 2013', 'the conjuring 2 2016' and, even, 'annabelle creation 2017'. that's because its plot is incredibly slim - i'm talking almost anecdotal - and it starts to wear thin far faster than it, perhaps, ought to. as such, the piece ends up somewhere in the middle, quality-wise, of the overall 'conjuring' franchise it's by no means bad but it's certainly not great, either. thankfully, though, it's a decently enjoyable, competently constructed experience throughout. the reason for this is, i feel, two-fold. firstly, its characters - on whom it relies solely because its plot is almost non-existent - are mostly well-rounded and believable. one of them does make some odd decisions that aren't explained until long after they've been made and, even then, don't stand up to all that much scrutiny. still, this isn't too detrimental and the development done for all the main players is serviceable enough, with some of it actually going a long way to plugging the potential leaks caused by those previously mentioned poor choices. plus, everyone on screen is, essentially, as likeable as they could be. unfortunately, they aren't quite interesting enough to keep you wholly engaged during the movie's slower segments. it has a really strange, somewhat disjointed pacing that practically paints most of it as an extended build-up for a seemingly fifteen-minute finale. luckily, then, it's competent when it comes to the second 'fold' of that two-fold reason i mentioned earlier the scares. while there's nothing outstanding here, it's also not just jump-scare central. there are are variety of occasionally quite inspired gags that often play on audience expectation, building up genuine suspense that isn't deflated every two minutes by an obnoxious 'false' fright. it does sometimes get a little too overt for its own good - though, the overall series is no stranger to bold, effects-based 'creatures', either - but it's refreshing, and sadly so, for a film like this to not be made of abrasive, repetitive, 'cattle-prod' stuff. generally, the flick is a fairly fun time. sure, it wears thin and is only ever so compelling in the first place, but it's a solid haunted house - literally and figuratively - that will certainly satisfy fans of the franchise. 610"", ""i'm a fan of the conjuring and the other annabelle movies but this one was disappointing. the acting was fine but the story a as weak and the ending was horrible. at least they kept the time period feeling. i expected more from this series."", ""i was disappointed with annabelle comes home because they had an immense list of material to use and they didn't. there were too many ideas and they all clashed and the story didn't make sense at times. the comedy scenes felt awkward and forced, just like the nun, and overall came across like it was supposed to be a teen suspense film rather than a horror film. it kept me at the edge off my seat a bit but never went beyond that. annabelle creation and the first conjuring are still the best films out of this whole franchise."", ""don't bother watching this movie. it's one of those standard production, boring and predictable movie."", ""the conjuring movies 1 2 are two of my favorite horror movies. the first annabelle movie was not great. the second one was actually very good. i did not have much by way of expectations, and this movie failed miserably to even meet those. pacing, horrendous. no warrens. too many unnecessary monsters and ghosts with little to no story or purpose. characters especially one doing the whole i'm-going-to-touch-this-or-go-in-here-because-i-can. honestly, the horror is skimpy and stereotypical. some scenes dragged on forever with no purpose. my wife, especially, was looking forward to this and is usually forgiving of bad horror movie elements, but even she called it trash. annabelle should have stayed away."", ""just been to see this and it was a lot of fun! like a traditional, spooky haunted house movie that actually had a bit of a goosebumps feel to it. there were some good jump-scares, one of which made me and everyone else in the cinema scream - it's never going to win an award... just go and enjoy it for what it is."", ""this film manages to set up tension nicely. the cinematography is solid and the score is on point. stylistically, this film felt more similar to the two 'conjuring' films than it did to the previous two 'annabelle' films. this isn't just because of the presence of the warren's, although they did help elevate the movie. it's because this film used the house, and the artifacts within, to great effect, i particularly liked that scene where the mirror shows you a little into the future, i thought it was a great scene and concept. the jump scares are quite effective. in terms of the acting, wilson and farmiga are great in their few scenes. i wish they'd played a bigger role here, but hopefully it shouldn't be too long till we see the warrens again in their own movie. the main characters are the three girls, all of which i thought were decent and likable enough."", 'nothing happens until half way of the movie. i was almost sleeping. there is no story, there is no end, there is no scary parts. terrible, huge regret.', 'nothing special in this film . the stupid teenage girl which makes the worst decisions and decides to get in the basement . she touched everything bla bla bla. it has some decent moments some good jumpscares . just 1 questions . how can 3 girls defeat so many demons !?!?', ""thought this movie would be about ed and lorraine warren but instead i had to watch three kids running around a house for an hour and 45 minutes. this movie would've been good if the production was well executed."", ""ok so i am writing this from the point of view of someone who hasn't seen any of the annabelle movies thus far. i loved this movie. everything about it. great acting and very scary !! this is good enough to be a stand alone movie in my opinion. most movies are boring after 2 or 3 are made but not this. very entertaining to watch. jumped off of my seat and almost tore off my husbands arm but so worth it haha."", 'drama, likable characters and terrific acting especially from mckenna grace are enough to compensate for the small scares annabelle comes home gives. also, the movie is miles better than the previous conjuring film la llorona.', ""as a fan of horror movies i found that movie not that scary yea there were some good jumpscares but the overall story of the movie wasn't that scary. if you are one of those people that gets scared easily then don't be that reluctant to watch it because it is not that scary""]",Gary Dauberman,Mckenna Grace,Madison Iseman,Katie Sarife,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRjYmQ5NTQtYzIyNi00MmNlLTlmNjYtNjQ3NzRlZmY3YjFlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"While babysitting the daughter of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a teenager and her friend unknowingly awaken an evil spirit trapped in a doll.",Horror

character and in its place in the ever-widening mcu. tom holland dons the webbed suit yet again as spider-man if he wasn't brilliant before, this time he seems even more comfortable in the role, delivering a charming, vulnerable and seemingly effortless performance. director jon watts also returns proving himself to be a sure hand, his clear vision for the film shining through with distinctive style. there's a notable new addition however in writers chris mckenna and erik sommers who deliver a smart script, often hilarious and always genuine. far from home is certainly a spider-man film on a sheer scale we haven't seen before largely, it's handled quite well, remaining mostly grounded amid globe-trotting and narrative twists and turns. occasionally, we lose some of the cohesion and it feels a little overstuffed and expository, but honestly this film is so fast-paced and energetic you can't help but enjoy the ride even when everything doesn't quite jell. equally, there are far too many brilliant aspects to take in take for instance the seamless action sequences which are neatly interchanged with intimate and believable drama. the temptation with movies of this kind is to fall into mindless action and forget the substance but far from home keeps its characters purely at its heart. there's nice references, for example, to endgame that really inform peter's arc in the film and provide the film's understated yet decidedly emotional impact. whilst the overall package might not be as tight as its predecessor, far from home makes appropriate attempts to hone in on some characters and narrative vignettes in more detail for example, zendaya's mj is far more fleshed out here and peter's own sense of identity and responsibility is thoughtfully explored. again, it's not all plain sailing jake gyllenhaal's syndrome-esque mysterio is very hit and miss, his great moments bogged down by some of the lesser writing and obligatorily clunky exposition.\nin the end, however, spider-man far from home is an impressive film, more than making up for its faults. it's fiercely entertaining, packed full of humour, action thrills and plenty of unexpected twists to keep the audience gripped speaking of which, stay for two critical post-credits scenes. equally, there's some fantastic visual effects work that sometimes even echoes of the illusionary sequences in doctor strange. jon watts and his team deliver a satisfying sequel here full of interesting choices yet still staying true to the style established in homecoming. ultimately, regardless of its position in the marvel canon, far from home has all the elements of the perfect summer popcorn movie action thrills, big laughs, a likeable cast and brilliant visuals really allow it to recover from momentary snags and reach the finish line in splendour. expertly crafted and with an unabashed sense of fun, spider-man far from home is an assured marvel instalment that hungers for a rewatch."", 'like most folks i absoultley adored this movie it had a ton of action and adventure there was even humor loved the characters of ned and mj the movie is a summer action movie lovers dream so so good

'skin' bluntly exposes mankind's seemingly limitless capacity for ignorance, and the continued clear and present threat of a totalitarian, propaganda-soaked media, and how 'polite' society's glacial indifference to poverty can actively inculcate murderous hate among the dispossessed.

portrays the complete, self-sacrificing devotion of a man for a woman than does milo ventimiglia i've believed in him since jessie in gilmore girls. amanda seyfried is a harder sell for me, though, so

love of a man and the devotion of a dog were winsome. the treachery and heartbreak were moving, so the magic was not totally lost on me. i give this film a 7 good out of 10, and if you need further encouragement to see it, my bookish friend has told me, nancy, i would give it 1110! i went to see it again. for me, it was about enzo, the dog who wanted to be people and the incredible bond between

blinded by the light,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8266310/,"[""i just saw this in a cineworld unlimited screening and, other than having seen the trailer and thought it looked ok, knew very little of blinded by the light. immediately a few people got up and walked out. ten minutes in a couple more joined them. others waited an hour, then popped off. some of these people - though not necessarily in the same screening as me - have added their 1-star review to imdb. these people should have their unlimited cards confiscated and be barred from cinemas and writing reviews permanently. sure, it's not a perfect film - springsteen is shoehorned in a cringeworthy number of times and the narrative has a paint-by-numbers feel to it - but it's a cheerful film with a good message do what makes you happy and don't be a douche. those giving the 1-star reviews really did miss the second part of the message.\nlook, it's an ok film. if you like bend it like beckham, you'll probably enjoy this. of you're a massive 'the boss' fan, you'll probably enjoy this. don't trust the 1-star reviews it's never a 1-star film. i'd probably really rate this 5 stars, but i'm adding one just to counter a couple of those

well. i like it."", 'we went to the 11th secret unlimited cineworld screening and had the pleasure to see this frankly amazing film. had no idea about it before hand but found it to be a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming film. the cinematography was fantastic, really sucking you into the story the film is telling, added to that the acting was superb, you could really feel the characters come to life making you feel each triumph and setback and get a true sense of the emotions each scene and character portrays. i would highly recommend you see this film, it really is fantastic.', ""director gurinder chadha burst into prominence with her 2002 hit bend it like beckham, a zesty coming of age story that broke the mould for asian representation in british cinema... and introduced the world to that modern english rose keira knightley, of course. since then, chadha has produced a filmography, wide-ranging in both genre and quality. whilst 2010's it's a wonderful afterlife was creaky and her latest period piece viceroy's house rather uninspiring, chadha appears to be back on surer ground with blinded by the light, an ode to bruce springsteen based on the memoir of real-life fanatic of the boss and journalist sarfraz manzoor. like many of chadha's films, blinded deals with themes of race, culture and integration in a brazen manner... but first and foremost, like her 2002 breakout, it's a feel-good coming of age comedy, easily accessible and perhaps somewhat trite as a sacrifice.\nthe story follows 16-year-old javed a fictionalised version of co-writer manzoor, the bookish and rather awkward son of first-generation pakistani immigrants played superbly by goodness gracious me alumnus kulvinder ghir and meera ganatra. it's the middle of thatcher era austerity in luton jobs are low, far-right skinheads roam the streets and the music of bruce springsteen has been relegated unceremoniously to the sort of thing your dad listens to. javed's life is on a definite downturn, as his aspirations to be a writer are refuted by his traditional father and his luck with the girls loiters in stupor. as soon as a friend encourages him to plug springsteen into his walkman you can feel chadha nostalgically grinning with the period detail it takes but a few lines of dancing in the dark for javed to be smitten. what follows is a coming of age tale that hits familiar beats not least from bend it with shameless confidence. there's much to appreciate in blinded by the light chadha is brilliant at conjuring likeable characters, ones with whom we can laugh, cry and dream effortlessly. virtual newcomer viveik kalra holds the film up with unbridled charisma as javed, whilst ghir plays his father with gusto, most impressive in the more dramatic moments. the film deals if all too broadly with some weighty themes in the midst of the fun, there's lingering political angst and even scenes of shocking racial abuse. chadha handles history thoughtfully the comparisons to today's britain, for example, are present for those who want to see them but don't feel forced. ultimately, however, the meat of the film lies in the relationship between javed and his father, one portrayed convincingly by both lead actors. central to the plot also is springsteen himself, of course, a constant messiah in javed's life here i was reminded of danny boyle's yesterday, a recent release that blindly expects you to take the beatle's iconic status for granted without ever exploring what makes them so great. it's pleasing then that here springsteen's importance is conveyed judiciously the way his anthems to blue collar america chime very personally with a young pakistani from luton is utterly believable.\ndespite this, blinded by the light is not a film quite worthy of heralding amidst the cleverer aspects of chadha's work, there's plenty of poor choices made that leave a strangely jerky end result. clear-cut narrative is dismissed in favour of messier storytelling romantic subplots meander in vague directions, characters become important for ten minutes then entirely disappear and the whole affair resolves in a rushed and corny conclusion. chadha, manzoor and paul mayeda berges' script is problematic too padded and cliched, it becomes increasingly lazy as the film progresses, choosing to have characters blindly quote springsteen lyrics in an attempt at profundity that feels very stilted. the filmmakers' love of the boss becomes painfully clear too to the point of overindulgence for instance we are treated to pretty much the entirety of born to run in a particularly stretched montage sequence. the incorporation of the music in the story as well becomes increasingly odd, with quasi-musical numbers and distracting graphics of lyrics floating across the screen. it appears to be an unfortunate trend in gurinder chadha's films that there is an abundance of flavours all thrown into the pot without enough thought into how well they will taste together. the conjunction of comedy and drama in blinded by the light stands starkly obvious whilst both goodness gracious me-esque humour and political commentary are done well here, the marriage between them feels slightly jarring throughout most of the film.\none might be able to overlook some of these errors if the film had the same level of charm as bend it like beckham and other similar fare... but despite its unabashed earnestness, blinded feels a little stuck in the mud and even its better aspects can't trump a progressively perfunctory and scattered delivery. no denying there's enough fun here to put a smile on the face... but no amount of goodwill can distract from one too many misfires."", ""the acting is fresh and charming, and direction is pacy and generally engaging. but once this tale gets stuck in the tramlines of its bend it like beckhambilly elliot youngster aiming to shake off parental oppression, you know exactly where it's going to take you. apart from the nasty national front scenes towards the end, this is a film with very little tension and next to zero surprises, plot twists and turns. and if a story lacks that in a film, then it really has a problem. it descends into a series of box ticking narrative requirements. i've read the book and it was funny and humane. but this film has not really delivered on the original text. it could have been so much better with a riskier and more daring script that wasn't afraid to get off those predictable tramlines."", ""the true story behind this title is tender and interesting. but i think it's a missed opportunity. it'a delicate film, with a couple of good characters, but in a way i find it perfect for disney channel or other super light and childish comedies. it's very didactic, full of cliché, you lose the story and hardly you can trust it. the use of bruce songs is absolutely exxxagerated, would have been much more interesting if they appeared just on 3 or 4 crucial moments. it is all built on springsteen songs, which is good for a super-fan as i am, but at the same time i think it's too much."", ""saw this as a secret screening at cineworld as part of there unlimited series. i can understand by the reviews are so mixed as it a very marmite film, i enjoyed the comedy one liners by the main character's dad, absolutely hated the middle 'grease' homage at which point i was ready to walk, but it pulled it back slightly for the end. the 80's soundtrack is cracking, and as a 80's boy bought up listening the same stuff and having been bought up on a strong diet of spingsteen by my old man growing up, i related strongly to it. it's not something i would see again, but i'm glad i did at the same time if that makes sense. not bad at all and better then the mostly negative reviews on here."", ""blinded by the light was an absolute joy! i wasn't expecting this movie to be great but it really surprised me. it's a story about a pakistani teenager from a complicated family and how he tries to find his own place in this world. the movie is very emotional and will make you sympathize with javid and what he's going through."", ""this was one of those movies that i'd watch the trailer and say to myself that looks good, i'll see that and the probably wouldn't because it wasn't mainstream enough for me to go to the cinema. but thankfully cineworlds secret screening was on even though i and possibly all the people that walked out during this movie were hoping to see the lion king early.\nit's throughly enjoyable, the music is great, bruce springsteen and eighties classics.\nit's a coming of age story to remind everyone that being true to yourself and becoming who you want to be doesn't mean leaving who you are and where you came from behind "", ""i loved this film. it is intelligent, warm and deeply moving, a story about cross-cultural differences, growing up with one foot in one culture and one foot in the other, adolescence, identity, isolation, alienation and journey to adulthood taking place in 1980s thatcher england, job loss, racial hostility and synth music. it's about a pakistani family, a sikh friend who loves the boss who is the boss of us all, sony walkmans, tape cassettes, working for a living and having skinheads spit on you. it's about loving words, having a passion for writing, paying attention to words and the words of a fellow poet, bruce. it's about parents, their sacrifices and struggles and the letting go. loss. and, it's about meaning. living a life with meaning, values and love. the film is well-written, acted, directed and edited. there is humor. there is not a false note anywhere. the only complaint i can make, and it's a very small one, because of my american ears, there were a couple of xs i did not understand the dialogue."", ""let's get something out of the way yes, this movie is sentimental and formulaic. however, chadha adds enough springsteen lyrics, bollywood musical elements, 80's coming-of-age moments, and political parallels to make all that formulaic sentimentality into something...different. it is a simple and complicated story all at once, partly because the characters are simple and complicated all at once. in other hands, this movie could have been just a musical comedy about a kid overcoming, but i could not help but care - about javed, about his family, about the town he wanted to escape. i will admit that's partly because i am an absolute sucker for springsteen, but the movie works regardless. i think? okay, i am a little biased here. still, it is not just about bruce bruuuuuuuce!!!. it is also about a filmmaker who gets this place, family, community, and music at a deeper level. her ability to see through these characters' eyes makes a simple story into something more. plus, bruce's old songs and the old prejudices of this film are more relevant than ever."", ""based in luton, perhaps, but plenty of hollywood reality in this. thatcher's britain, british racism, cultural differences within communities etc etc all have been dealt with better in other films. much of the cultural focus could have been cut and pasted from 'east is east'. the film is too long and contrived, with every point being made repeatedly and without subtlety.\nhowever, the acting is good and if you are satisfied with a happy ending, this may be one to watch""]",Gurinder Chadha,Viveik Kalra,Kulvinder Ghir,Meera Ganatra,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4YjY1NTItODUwNi00NDM2LWJjNTgtYjY4NmFiY2E5YzQ0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"In England in 1987, a

some time ago. i just wasn't a fan of how it all went down. some characters do absolutely ridiculous things that make no sense. there's at least one huge continuity issue. then there's an almost ridiculous spiritual undertone to this that i also felt was poorly executed. one of the main characters is dealing with a crisis of faith and he makes what i feel are some ridiculous choices that are supposed to be faith based. i feel like the writer or director has the notion that having faith negates the ability to reason. indeed i've known some people like this, but it's not the rule. the kind of people who don't lock their door because god's looking out for them. inevitably they're burglarized or worse. god gave you the ability to reason and a lock to keep people out  i digress... this could have been a good film especially with the main cast. unfortunately it wasn't, and for numerous reasons.""]",Franck Khalfoun,Logan Miller,Kristine

pictured it to be a mixture of the timelessness of their previous films and the entertainment of the nightmare before christmas - fun for the whole family. however, as a young adult, i was not in the least bit entertained. the story line was definitely created for children, depicting the importance of inclusionacceptance and family bond. which i'm sure is very important for the younger generations. yet i just was unable to connect with my long-standing enthusiasm for the addams family during this movie."", ""the intention here is obviously to introduce a new generation to the addams family. the film starts completely fresh and tells the origins of the entire family as a stand alone film. as someone who grew up watching the 90s films, cartoons, and re-runs i actually didn't mind this. they presented a straightforward well contained story that has plenty of jokes for both children and adults, which i laughed at enough of to stay entertained throughout the film."", ""the addams family 2019 is a very run of the mill animated film that ends up feeling very average.\nbeing a major fan of the addams family from the original films from the 90s i was really disappointed with the film. our story follows the entire addams family years after they have moved into their mansion being hidden there for years after being chased away by angry civilians. now since to a new house flip tv show, they are discovered with the show host wanting to destroy their house to make it fit in with the neighborhood. on top of that pugsly addams is having to prepare to do a famous sword pattern that is a tradition to prove he is truly an addams. in front of the entire addams family and all their relatives. this subplot with pugsly is one of many there is even another one about wednesday addams trying to fit in at school becoming an issue with the film having too many subplots. the main message of the film is one we have heard 100 times with accepting people in your town who are different because we are all unique in our own ways. this is a good message for kids but the message is shoved in way too much, and they don't reinvent the presentation of the message in any way, or try anything new to make it more interesting. i thought the film never fully did the characters justice especially the family relationship aspect. it had a few great performances that being chole grace moretz as wednesday addams and charlize theron as morticia addams. some of the imagery can be pretty cool with the house, using the character designs from the original comic strip and some scenes have good humor. major issues with the film are in the story being extremely basic and not taking many risks. with like i mentioned earlier way too many subplots that can be extremely uninteresting. overall the addams family ends up being just okay with a few good moments sprinkled throughout but having an extremely basic story and not going all the way with the family's classic humor, dark style."", ""i kept wanting it to be funny. i was cheering it on ok, be funny now or something. anything. with the amazing cast this movie has i thought they could pull something off. they didn't."", ""i took my 2 younger brothers to go see this since we all had time off from school and wanted an excuse to binge eat movie theater popcorn- this movie is made for literal children, im

there that are laughable for older audience members, but the movie as a whole isn't very exciting. they stress the idea of accepting the 'outsiders' so much that it loses the whole macabre spooky halloween type movie feel, and instead its like the minions trying to befriend normal people. the animation is predictable and fine but the stylistic choices and overall art style is very ugly, and not in a charming tim burton or hotel transylvania type of way. one of my brothers compared the whole family to 'fancily dressed crackheads' after the movie and we laughed. at least morticia looks okay. gomez just looks like hitler. just wait for this to come out on netflix or something"", ""not sure what movie the majority of the critics have seen, for i saw a fairly entertaining reimagining

be brilliantly selected."", ""if your an adult looking to find deeper meaning in an animated move this isn't for you. if you want to watch your kids enjoying a movie while you eat popcorn and drink

polaroid camera and the teens that get ahold of it. the lighting and tension is actually very well done and built rather well, and i was genuinely tense a few times. there is also some great usage of certain sfx that create a very unsettling sonic atmosphere. the teen centered story can get slightly annoying and cliche at times but it just comes with the territory. i thought there was a certain backstory that was very unnerving as well and by the time the intense finale arrives, everything is that much more effectively frightening as things are amped up. overall it's going to be slated for

frozen ii,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4520988/,"[""it's not hard to imagine how big this movie will be. i, as well as many others, am a huge fan of the first film and the short films that followed it. frozen ii has a different feel to it. while the first film was brimming with quirky moments, the follow up feels a little more mature in its plot and themes. this story heavily centers around the importance of change, even if that means letting go. throughout the film, i found myself dazzled with the quality and beauty of the visuals that the animation team laid out. the story, for me, felt a little flat, however. i think the writing team missed the mark when trying to achieve the same quirkiness from the original. with the more dramatic path the writers chose to take, also came more epic musical numbers and effects. sure there were still plenty of humorous moments, but i personally felt myself longing for more. i also find irony in the fact that this film centers around change and the overall feel of the film felt like a major shift from the first. i do think this film will still appeal to many others and i, myself, am still very excited to watch it a second time. overall, i'd say this film found success in what it was trying to achieve and the message it was trying to send to its viewers, but couldn't quite live up to the whimsicality of the original. while not as good as the first, it's still a film you will want to take your family to and is a great addition to the frozen franchise. 710"", ""frozen ii felt unsatisfying. there was lots of build up to a very short climax that felt way too easy and simple. i kept expecting another adventure which never came. the film feels short and unfinished. that said, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and i did find the film quite funny. if you go into this with low expectations i think you'll enjoy yourself."", 'the animation in frozen ii is stunning. the level of detail and flow is a triumph. the story, however, is preachy and forced. anna is annoyingly controlling and overprotective. all of the songs are overwrought and not really memorable, and the characters sing a lot. no need to buy this one, one viewing is enough.', ""this is a beautiful movie, and elsa's journey is a powerful one to watch. but outside of this it's narrative is completely unfocused and none of the character moments are given the time they deserve on screen. it seems that it's trying to be more adult with more lore and a darker tone, but also still gives olaf an unnecessary about of screen time doing things that the little kids would laugh at. the pacing also feels quite rushed, even by kids movie standards. you could have cut 20 minutes out of this movie and it would have been just as good."", ""unlike most sequels disney make, this one tried. i saw the document series and everyone wanted to make this a great film but it ultimately misses the mark. the plot is a mess, new characters are barely used, and the songs aren't as catchy as let it go. although i still have respect to everyone who had passion making this maybe disney should consider letting people have more time to fix story problems."", ""i'm not sure why some people say it sucked. i went with my nephew and i thought the story was good and kept me intrigued throughout and had so many emotions, great visuals and was as good if not better than the first. i would def. recommend this movie if you liked the 1st one!

with so much money disney has they should be able to hire writers who can come up with a good story, would you think! i am convinced that everyone who contributed to this has never seen the first part of the film and therefore has done something that makes this film a circus. because this film has absolutely no quality or is in a way funny."", 'i have to give credit where credit is due, for the effort of trying to make an original storyline. but unfortunately they ended up with a mismatch of a tale, which is unnecessarily complicated. a great visual experience, however a fail of a sequel. the music is also lacklustre, and nowhere near as catchy as the first title.', 'having seen both the first frozen and frozen 2 as an adult, my perspective might be different from others, but i have to say i actually like the second one better. the music is more interesting, the message is less simple and cheesy, and the effects are stunning. granted, the story is a little complicated, but only enough to make it interesting. and let me say it again, the music is definitely better!

transitioned from the old grainy film of the 70s show to a well shot scene in an apartment it was very jarring at first but it happens less often as the movie progresses. tom hanks does an amazing job

half its run time . but , to be honest, it's ok. it's a very unique and intriguing story and i really enjoyed watching it. it just leaves you wanting more of its greatest moments  the recreation of sets, the transitions between scenes and of course tom hanks amazing performance. he truly becomes fred roger's , right down to body ticks and glares . every moment he's on screen joy came across my face and i was whisked back to my childhood .\nunfortunately, something just feels forced about the other half , emotion just doesn't connect the way it should and some scenes feel out of place and oddly humorous. one such scene , a trippy nightmare , sticks out like a sore thumb . sometimes things feel forced in as mr. roger's greatest hits then actual moments from the main characters encounters and they're extremely noticeable and out of place . all of this just doesn't gel into a cohesive piece like it should. you will find , however, a great message that really makes you feel inspired. i guess that's more mr. roger's then i give it credit for."", ""i like tom hanks, i like mr. rogers. i don't like tom hanks as mr. rogers. mr. rogers spoke deliberately, but was still lively and peppy. the tom hanks version, was more like someone talking and reacting to nyquil. the cadence of mr. hanks, does not match the mr. rogers i grew up with, the second distraction, was the movie concentrated on the life of another man, that at first, had very little regard for mr. rogers. i understand that the overall storyline was, mr. rogers changed the lives of those he met, personally or through a television. a biography would have been an appropriate vehicle for the life of this simple but complex man. the move did have its high points, such as fred rogers getting into the character of his puppets, his humility and accessibility, even if it conflicted with the time table of his producers. overall an ok movie, but the 2018 won't you be my neighbor? was a much better film, that

daniel isn't real,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8745960/,"[""rating this movie with the lowest score possible is just ridiculous. people should think a bit about it before rating movies, as a one star movie is just awful, almost unwatchable, and in this case daniel isn't real is certainly watchable. i get it that not everybody will love it but just rate it honestly. if you like movies like donnie darko 2001 or split 2016 you should enjoy this one as well. the other two mentioned are way better, no doubt about that, but daniel isn't real has some good moments. the acting was good, really can't say anything bad about that even if i tried my best, the story is certainly entertaining to follow, the cinematography was way better than i expected it to be. just do me a favor and rate your movies correctly, stop with those perfect tens for average movies, and certainly stop with insulting one star ratings for movies like this one."", ""this film has it's moments. there is not, at least in my opinion, a clear cut direction laid out but it does have a way of drawing you in. however, it felt a bit tedious at times and i was wanting it to move along a bit better. as my title indicates, i didn't love or hate it but it was an interesting watch."", 'oh no! i really wanted to like this more. it started out quite interesting and i was ready for the excitement to begin. sadly it was mostly disappointing for me. there were really good moments but then a bunch of confusing, nonsensical silliness. i just quit caring about a third of the way through. sorry but not for me but i am sure that others might like it better.', ""i rated this film a 7, fair, which isnt a 10 or a 1 which this film is neither of anyway. it's worth watching, good storyline, casting was good, directing was really good and maybe helped garner the rating for me, special effects were even fairly good, one scene in particular and several others were close. what docked the points was it felt a little rushed at times, some of the acting and scenarios were cheesy and seemed out of character, especially the doctor. the final solve seemed sort of pushed out and not pulled out with some logical investigative deducements. so then the end was a little hard to decipher and didnt really fit with the rest of the movies flow and style and here was also some very bad special effects happening that was distracting from the cohesiveness and melodic translation of the first 34 of the film. so its definitely worth a look, prepare to be pleased but not rocked, but also not skunked. it's only a fair movie but i think most thrillerhorrordrama fans will agree."", ""schwarzenegger crushed... you can see a bright future for his acting career... honestly if you like horror movies, you should give this a watch... you shouldnt even take reviewers who give out 1's and 10's seriously anyway... little bit of psychological horror, little bit of body horror, little bit of gore... nice combination to make a solid horror flick."", ""when luke miles robbins was a little boy he made friends with another little boy named daniel. but as luke discovers, daniel is a bad influence for him. luke also discovers that daniel is just an imaginary friend and is not real. after a horrific trauma, luke is forced to get rid of daniel by locking him up in a doll house. in the present day, luke miles robbins is now a college freshman. unfortunately for luke, he is having problems dealing with personal traumas. thinking the release of daniel patrick schwarzenegger may allow him to move forward from his current status luke releases daniel from the doll house, discovering daniel is now a similar age. daniel agrees to help luke with his life and personal issues. but little does luke know that daniel has plans that are far worse than he could ever imagine. if you've ever seen the film drop dead fred 1991, the best way to describe this film is to use the same concept but turn it into a horror movie. it's a concept that i really liked the sound of but its results are a mixed bag for me. the look and tone of this film is great. it's as dark and gritty as you would expect a horror film to be. the film's setting and locations were also positive to see. eerie sounds tracks were also used to give a nice compliment to the overall horror tones. daniel isn't real has a positive first act with a good general plot and introduction. we gain a good amount of information about luke's upbringing and the problems that are occurring within his own home. the introduction to a young daniel is also positive and it's enjoyable to see this new friendship develop only to turn dark. the film's ending no spoilers was also enjoyable even though final moments did cause me to raise both my eyebrows and left me with unanswered questions. the biggest problem with daniel isn't real is found in its second act. once luke and daniel are reunited at an older age the plot is pretty slowed down with the two leads spending their time going to clubs, drinking and hooking up with girls. luke seems to think partying with an imaginary friend is the answer to his problems. at no point does the older luke of the second act even question who daniel really is or why daniel found luke in the first place. nor does luke seems concerned with daniel's interactions in their past... the relationship is accepted far too easily and what they do together at first is... well not whole lot. but it's obvious that daniel generally isn't happy with luke. some tense moments are had as the audience sees things from daniel's perspective. another struggle for me were some of the key performances in this film, particularly when it came to the actor patrick schwarzenegger who plays daniel. the relationship between luke and daniel can feel fickle and even unconvincing. it just feels like we see two mates going out for fun. i found myself needing to remind myself of the film's initial plot from time to time because performances didn't feel consistent. overall, daniel isn't real brings a fantastic concept to the horror genre. while the film's concept, filming style and gritty tone are appealing to me, unfortunately the film let its audience down with the key performances and minor details within the core of its plot. the first and final act are generally enjoyable, but i'm left with questions which have no answers, and in the end i felt this was a truly mixed bag with missed opportunities. 4.710 - walkden entertainment"", ""the actors do a good job with patrick schwarzenegger standing out. the directing is pushing the psychedelic button with the wannabe eary music and reddish and yellowish light effects a bit too much in my opinion but all in gets the point across. not sure i'd have payed to see it at the movies as it has it's lengths and with a run time of 100 minutes it's pushing its luck. for those that like movies with mind tricks, dual personality issues and so forth, you'll find what you need here."", 'the story is so different from what i expected. it is engaging, thrilling and scary. it is definitely worth a watch!', ""while slow to start and a bit tough to follow at times, this movie proposes an interesting and dare i say reasonable concept from the beginning - a darker perspective on having an imaginary friend as a child. but it's so much more than that. boundaries are pushed and expectations are thrown out the window during the 100min runtime, particularly in the second half. around 40min in, we finally get a glimpse of why this is deemed a horror movie, and the practicalcosmetic effects are superb, especially for a low budget flick. these visual horror elements are not overdone, but used theatrically moving forward, to punctuate key turning points. i can't say i'm a huge fan of how they ended it, but part of me is inherently a fan of ambiguity over overtness in cinema. both miles robbins and patrick schwarzenegger we're great, as was mary stewart masterson. theoretically there's a lot of room for a sequel, or even a prequel the creators did a great job composing an expandable universe with this one."", ""daniel isn't real is set in the world of mental illness, but it isn't about mental illness. the main character luke seemingly struggles with some sort of cognitive and psychiatric issue upon the return of his imaginary friend daniel from childhood. questions of mental illness plague luke given his mother's own psychosis. but daniel may be more than just the imaginary friend of luke and the personification of luke's libidinal impulses. and, this fantasy or supernatural element could place luke outside the realm of your average psychiatric case. or not. you decide."", ""like as if a teendrama novel was turned into a movie. this wouldn't be the worse thing but the movie starts out so much more incredibly raw than it turns out to be. we start with a boys imaginary friend telling him prescription pills will give his mother superpowers, so he dumps them in the blender. then halfway through the movie the imaginary friend literally becomes a wingman to help him impress the girl and look like a great guy. hmm. i just don't know. it seems to be either the kind of movie that does not take the viewer seriously or it just had serious creative difficulties in the writing process. it comes off looking tacky, like it is a kid trying to make an adult movie. it's disapointing because the music and cinematography really had me at some moments"", 'are your inner demons real? an entertaining psychological horror. it boldly examines challenging subjects like mental illnesses alongside the struggle for self-confidence. how it handles mental health is thought-provoking and it never demonises suffers of these real-life issues.', ""the plot is already questionable but throw in patrick's acting and the film becomes a comedy. also, i'm tired of movies always having that type of girl in movies. you know she shows up uninvited, invites people she barely knows into her home, is a bit wild but caring enough to make up for it and of course she has to be an artist. yeah we've seen it before. this film is ridiculous."", ""this is a pretty interesting, especially for the first half or so, horror film about an imaginary friend, daniel, that a young child, luke, has put to rest due to pressure from his mother. that's that until later in life when this child grows into a rather troubled nerdy introvert, played by miles robbins, has problems socializing and seeks help from a psychiatrist who rather bizarrely suggests that he resurrect this imaginary friend thinking it might help him cope dealing with others. we then get an adult version of the friend and things go swimmingly...for a while as eventually good old daniel has a mind of his own and more beyond that. up until this point all of this makes for a somewhat fascinating little horror tale, but it turns into something that at times is a bit ridiculous. all in all though, it's an unusual horror film. it's biggest asset is robbins who is very good. patrick schwarzenegger plays the adult daniel. the problems with the script is with this character and i'm not sure if it's well played or not, but it is ominous, so i guess schwarzenegger does well enough in the role. i didn't even realize until it was over that mary stuart

progressively grimmer. its religiosity was something of a challenge to me, as was its stilted dialogue. its story is the familiar one of a man suffering for what he believes. it is the story of john procter, the hero of arthur miller's play the crucible it is the story of ibsen's dr stockmann, in the play enemy of the people. and of course it's the story of jesus christ. there is a tragic grandeur to all of these, and, whatever my reservations about it, there is tragic grandeur to a hidden life. my husband found it unbearably pretentious. i can see why. but i admire the way that this

life tells a true, hitherto hardly publicly perceived story of a resistance fighter who rebelled without any great gestures against hitler and the third reich in a lyrical-meditative style as a jesus allegory. this film works as a philosophical love story, which, precisely because it tells a different view of the second world war, stands out particularly and is another well-made work by the long-established director terrence malick.', ""i like slow, absorbing films as much as the next guy. but really, this should not be a three-hour film. you do feel something for the characters. but the film is not that well executed. there doesn't seem to be enough background to the story -- we don't see, as one might expect. a protagonist with historical ties to the land, with deep-seated friendships and relationships that are tested. and the wrestling of his soul is protracted yet also seems somehow light and not consequential. but the length is my biggest gripe. a two-hour movie would have been better."", 'a cinematographic tour de force! this is an almost flawless movie and a true metaphysical drama. probably the best movie of the toronto international film festival. base on a true story the photography is breath taking. you have to see it!', 'you feel than it is a film by terrence malick. and, knowing before the first scenes the story of franz jagestatter you have the certitude than nobody except him can give, in fair manner, the story of the austrian blessed. sure, the image and the storytelling and the perfect cast. but more. a sort of thrill about a delicate theme not so easy to present in right way. and a great film about conscience against dictatorship. the source of force -,off course, is the image but, more important, the status of contemporary story. it represents a form of warning. clear and high precise send to us.', ""finally terrence malick is back with a real masterpiece and his best film since the tree of life. its a film that really gets under your skin if you embrace to it. malick's longest film is also one of his most emotional and thought provoking ones in a way. we show two different worlds colliding with each other. malick takes a lot of time to really show the idyllic and peaceful life of austrian villagers, far away from the cruelty of the world, but collides with it when one of the villagers is called in for war but declines. august diehl wonderfully plays this real life figure and gives a truly tour de force performance. a performance that is only challenged by valerie pachner who is just outstanding, especially in the second half of the film. we got the last roles of bruno ganz and michael nyqvist, although rather cameos than real supporting roles but thats most of the cast expect for diehl and pachner as those two actors play characters that embodie the whole emotions of people that are forced into a war they dont want.\ntypically for terrence malick you are treated with a fantastic cinematography. unforgettable images of pure and innocent nature. it is fantastic how he links that to the true hell...and combines it take notice of the constant bird singing in the film he uses it as its second protagonists and symbol the same time. also the score by james newton howard is fantastic and emotional. it is long yes but except for a section after 2 hours it doesn't feel like it because malick needs that time to bring the people, their believes and culture close to his audience."", ""the plot is well adapted, you empathize with characters for obvious reasons family and respecting your own ideas.\nhave to say, i have so much trouble with the editing.\nalso, a very long movie, some scenes are useless, that makes this movie kind of slow.\nin the end great movie, good acting for no experienced actors except for the principal, great screenplay, and the cinematography and score are just the best of the movie.\nartsy movie, understandable if you get bored, but it's almost imposible to understand someone can hate it or give it a 110."", 'how do you make a film about conflict, and in particular war, without showing a drop of blood? well, terence malick answers this question. almost 3 hours flew by for me, when watching this visual feast. his usual obsession with filming grass and greenery is deeply indulged. the photography is beautiful and the music is sublime. the story is a very simple one about a complex issue ie conscientious objection during world war 2. the performances are so spontaneous looking it is hard to believe it was directed at all. the portrayal of brutality in the film is so multi layered and realised so clearly, it makes the warm and loving moments so much more deeply effective. the space given to moment after moment invites us into this world so much so that you can smell the air and be as present in the scenes as any of the characters in the film. this piece is a great gift to the art visual storytelling.', 'this touched me on so many levels. what does life mean? what does faith mean? what does a good life mean and how do you balance the needs of your family against your values. so much is explored at so many different levels. this film touched me so deeply. why oh why does humanity continue with this terrible cycle? this film captures it all. from the simplicity and the importance of the grass and the sunshine to the other extreme of the worst of humanity. so brilliant and will make you question the key moments that have made your life worth living. watch it and feel it - truly inspiring and life affirming.', ""yes, this film tells a good story, has good acting, and is beautifully filmed, but it is overlong and becomes tedious. the story of a conscientious objector and outsider in greater germany during world war ii is very similar to 2013's 13 minutes, which is told in a much tighter, traditional pace. i usually don't even know the director's name when i watch a film, but while watching this one, i couldn't help but notice similarities to the near-great but disappointing the new world from 2005. lo and behold, both were directed by malick, and both suffer from way too many long pauses in the dialogue. to pan around the countryside to show how idyllic a farm community is might work three or four times, but it happens maybe 25 times. malick should have cut an hour and added connecting dialogue throughout."", ""terence malick has made some unique and wonderful films. this time, i feel he's reached a 'style over substance' moment that can't be overlooked. the story of a conscientious objector during wwii is certainly a workable topic. but this movie seems determined to be another ethereal art piece that's sort of a movie. the narrative is kept simple, not reaching the soulful depths i was expecting. the cinematography is fine but it's not life-changing. i mean, the location is really the star, and the angles and shots are merely relaying a background of beauty in other words, filming in the bavarian alps you tend to get a lot of breathtaking shots. so what you end up getting is three hours of overindulgence in movie-making, and not a satisfying experience. i think malick's deepest fan base will like it, but objectively, i don't see the greatness in this film, but perhaps great material to debate in a college classroom.""]",Terrence Malick,August Diehl,Valerie Pachner,Matthias

inconsequential moment in chinonye chukwu's sophomore feature effort, clemency, yet its essence reverberates through every frame. 2019 has been filled with films about wrongly incarcerated men, from destin daniel cretton's stirring fact-based drama, just mercy, to terrence malick's poetic meditation on righteous sacrifice. as prison warden bernadine woodard walks dutifully to work down a corridor during the opening moments of chukwu's film, a barred security door framed in the foreground slams shut behind her. it's one of numerous instances in the film where ace cinematographer eric branco makes bernadine appear as incarcerated as the doomed men she councils. the disconnect that has grown between the warden and her husband, jonathan wendell pierce, causes him to dub her an empty shell, yet there's a sense that bernadine has attempted to shield him from the demons that cause her to bolt upright in bed at night. what follows is one of the most harrowing death scenes ever put on film, and what makes it extraordinary is the fact that we experience it solely through the expressions of bernadine. as marty tells anthony during their final moments together, all any of us ever want is to be seen and heard, and the crowds of protestors lining up daily to loudly condemn his client's fate provide undeniable proof that news of the injustice has spread throughout the world. of course, this is little consolation for a prisoner forced to spend the majority of his days in silence and solitude, yet when anthony is strapped to a crucifix-like chair and given his lethal injection, it's as if his pain and anguish is injected directly into bernadine. for the first time, she finds herself at a loss for words, just as anthony was during her feeble attempts at interaction. you can literally spot the moment when her soul appears to have left her body. this is screen acting of a very rare sort, and clemency is a vital emotional powerhouse sorely deserving of being seen. in a breathtaking three-minute shot on par with the finale of céline sciamma's portrait of a lady on fire, the camera holds on bernadine's face as the primal horror of the procedure she has overseen for years finally sinks in, breaking through her hardened exterior until he flatlines, prompting her own body to go limp."", 'slow moving drama, and though about a serious subject failed to emotionally connect with me.', ""i'm very disappointed across the board. the acting was pretty good. very good at times. but so much of the movie's energy was negative and dark. i understand that it was intended as a major dose of reality. but many opportunities were missed to round out the story and to provide valuable takeaways. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone except perhaps for capital punishment activists."", ""alfre woodard was robbed. there is no reason that this performance wasn't nominated for an oscar. her quiet pain is palpable. i find it tragic that more quality movies like this don't get more attention. strong performances all around. aldis hodge is a rising star. keep your eye on him."", ""this features a really poignant and strong effort from alfre woodard as the warden of a prison charged with ensuring the execution of prisoners. she, bernadine is finding it increasingly more difficult to reconcile the responsibilities of her job with her own conscience and her marriage. none of these demons are helped when one such procedure goes awry and, though not her fault, she finds herself under increased scrutiny as aldis hodge's woods is soon to follow. the performance elements of this from woodard and from wendell pierce as her loving but increasingly exasperated husband jonathan work well, creating a really quite powerful vision of a woman torn between remaining objective - she is, after all, doing her job - and of a woman increasingly appreciative of the terminal nature of her task and of her own failings and religiosity. the remainder of the drama, last minute appeals etc., works less well and richard schiff really doesn't deliver much at all as the convicted man's attorney lumetta - a man who seems to be trying to imbue hope in a man based on wishful thinking and some far-fetched technicalities. auteur chinonye chukwu takes her time with this impassioned story and that's no bad thing at times, allowing us to become a little more immersed in the character of the troubled bernadine. at other times, though, the pace really does need a bit of a shake. the whole isn't as good as the sum of the parts, but it's still quite a thought-provoking look at just where responsibility lies in circumstances none of us would ever want to experience."", 'this movie, i expected something exciting, a storyline perhaps or something
